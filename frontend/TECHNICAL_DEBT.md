# Technical Debt Document

## TypeScript and Linting Issues (Priority: High)
To be addressed in the next development sprint:

1. Type Safety Issues
- Replace `any` types with proper TypeScript types throughout the codebase
- Locations: src/lib/api/, src/lib/monitoring/, src/components/
- Impact: Improved type safety and better IDE support

2. Unused Variables and Imports
- Clean up unused variables and imports
- Remove or utilize declared but unused variables
- Impact: Reduced bundle size and improved code clarity

3. React Best Practices
- Replace `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image>` components
- Add proper alt text to all images
- Replace HTML anchors with Next.js `<Link>` components
- Impact: Better performance and accessibility

4. Code Quality
- Fix React hooks dependencies
- Address unescaped entities in text content
- Convert var declarations to const/let
- Impact: Better maintainability and fewer potential bugs

## Action Plan
1. Create TypeScript utility types for common patterns
2. Set up automated tests for type coverage
3. Implement stricter ESLint rules gradually
4. Add pre-commit hooks to prevent new technical debt

## Timeline
- Target completion: Next development sprint
- Estimated effort: 3-5 days

## Monitoring
- Set up TypeScript strict mode after cleanup
- Re-enable ESLint rules one by one
- Add type coverage reporting to CI pipeline
