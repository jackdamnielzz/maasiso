# Current Project Status Report
Date: 2024-01-24

## Current Situation

We are currently working on implementing and testing the blog functionality in the MaasISO website project. The focus is on ensuring proper content type configuration in Strapi CMS and verifying the data flow between the CMS and frontend. The central components in this effort are:

1. Strapi CMS Content Types:
   - Blog Post
   - Page
   - Category
   - Tag
   - Various page components (Hero, Text Block, Feature Grid, etc.)

2. Frontend Components:
   - `/app/blog/page.tsx` - Main blog listing page
   - `/components/features/BlogCard.tsx` - Blog post preview component
   - `/components/common/CategoryFilter.tsx` - Category filtering component
   - `/components/common/Pagination.tsx` - Pagination component

### Current Focus

The primary focus is on setting up and testing the blog functionality, specifically:

1. Content Type Configuration
   - Verifying Blog Post content type structure
   - Testing category and tag relationships
   - Ensuring proper component inheritance

2. Frontend Implementation
   - Blog listing page setup
   - Category filtering
   - Pagination
   - Blog post display

The desired outcome is to have a fully functional blog section that can display posts with proper categorization, filtering, and pagination.

### Component Relationships

The blog system consists of several interconnected components:

- Strapi CMS: Manages content types and relationships
- Frontend Blog Page: Displays posts and handles filtering/pagination
- API Layer: Handles data fetching and normalization
- Component System: Renders different content blocks within blog posts

## Problems/Challenges

### 1. Content Type Structure

**Location**: Strapi CMS Content Type Builder

**Nature**: Need to ensure proper structure for:
- Blog posts with inherited templates
- Category relationships
- Component integration

**Impact**: This affects how content can be created and managed in the CMS, and how it's displayed in the frontend.

### 2. Page Structure Requirements

**Location**: Strapi CMS and Frontend

**Nature**: Need to create proper page structure in CMS to support:
- Blog listing page
- Individual blog post pages
- Category filtering

## Solution Attempts

### 1. Blog Post Content Type

We've created a test blog post with inherited template functionality:

```typescript
// Test blog post structure
{
  title: "Test Blog Post with Inherited Template",
  slug: "blog-post",
  categories: ["Templates", "Development"],
  content: "Test content demonstrating template inheritance...",
  seoTitle: "Template Inheritance System Test Post",
  seoDescription: "Testing the new template inheritance system..."
}
```

### 2. Frontend Blog Page Implementation

The blog page implementation includes:

```typescript
// frontend/app/blog/page.tsx
async function BlogContent({ searchParams }: BlogPageProps) {
  const [response, categoriesResponse] = await Promise.all([
    getBlogPosts(currentPage, 6, selectedCategory),
    getCategories()
  ]);

  return (
    <div className="bg-white py-24">
      <div className="container-custom">
        <CategoryFilter 
          categories={categoriesResponse.categories}
          selectedCategory={selectedCategory}
        />
        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
          {response.blogPosts.data.map((post: BlogPost) => (
            <BlogCard post={post} />
          ))}
        </div>
        <Pagination {...paginationProps} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Create blog page in CMS
   - Set up page structure with appropriate components
   - Configure layout for blog listing

2. **Secondary Priority**: Test blog post display
   - Verify data flow from CMS to frontend
   - Test category filtering
   - Verify pagination

3. **Future Improvements**:
   - Add search functionality
   - Implement tag filtering
   - Add related posts feature

## Required Actions

1. Create blog page in Strapi CMS
2. Configure page layout components
3. Test blog post listing and filtering
4. Document content type structures

## Success Criteria

1. Blog page displays correctly with proper layout
2. Blog posts appear in listing with correct categorization
3. Category filtering works as expected
4. Pagination functions properly

This situation requires careful attention to content structure while ensuring proper integration between the CMS and frontend components. The next steps should focus on creating the blog page in the CMS before proceeding with frontend testing.
