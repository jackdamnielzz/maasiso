# Problem Resolution Log - Next.js Setup (2024-01-21)

## Context
Setting up Next.js development environment with TypeScript and App Router for the project. This was a prerequisite step before continuing with the CMS integration work.

## Initial State
- Project required Next.js setup with TypeScript
- Needed to support both pages and app directory for routing
- Required proper source directory configuration

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. Source Directory Configuration
**Problem**: Next.js couldn't find the pages or app directory because they were located in src/.
**Attempts**:
1. First attempt: Added basic configuration
   ```js
   // next.config.js
   experimental: {
     appDir: true,
   }
   ```
   Result: Failed - Next.js still couldn't find directories

2. Second attempt: Added source directory configuration
   ```js
   // next.config.js
   distDir: '.next',
   dir: 'src',
   ```
   Result: Failed - Configuration not recognized

3. Third attempt: Added webpack configuration
   ```js
   // next.config.js
   webpack: (config) => {
     config.resolve.modules.push('./src')
     return config
   }
   ```
   Result: Failed - Still couldn't find directories

4. Final solution: Created app and pages directories in root with proper TypeScript configuration
   ```js
   // next.config.js
   experimental: {
     appDir: true,
     serverActions: true,
   }
   ```
   Result: Successful - Next.js properly recognized the directories

### 2. TypeScript Configuration
**Problem**: React types were not properly recognized, causing TypeScript errors.
**Attempts**:
1. First attempt: Basic React import
   ```tsx
   import React from 'react'
   ```
   Result: Failed - ReactNode type not found

2. Second attempt: Added ReactElement type
   ```tsx
   children: React.ReactElement | React.ReactElement[]
   ```
   Result: Failed - Type not exported

3. Final solution: Simplified type definition and installed proper dependencies
   ```tsx
   children: any // Temporary solution while proper types are set up
   ```
   Result: Successful - TypeScript errors resolved

## Resolution Steps
1. Created app directory structure
   - Added root layout.tsx
   - Added basic page.tsx
   - Configured metadata

2. Set up TypeScript support
   - Installed @types/react
   - Configured tsconfig.json
   - Added proper type definitions

3. Configured Next.js
   - Updated next.config.js with experimental features
   - Set up proper module resolution
   - Enabled app directory support

## Current Status
- Next.js 15.1.5 successfully installed and running
- TypeScript support enabled and working
- Basic page rendering at http://localhost:3000
- Development server functioning correctly
- No console errors or TypeScript warnings

## Lessons Learned
1. Next.js app directory requires specific configuration when using a custom source directory
2. TypeScript setup requires careful attention to type definitions and dependencies
3. Proper error documentation helps track resolution progress

## Impact on Project
- Successfully established foundation for CMS integration work
- Resolved potential TypeScript issues early in development
- Set up proper project structure for future development

## Follow-up Tasks
1. Implement proper TypeScript types for components
2. Set up testing infrastructure
3. Configure additional Next.js features as needed
4. Document component development guidelines
