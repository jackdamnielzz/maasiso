# Problem Entry [2025-01-13] - PG001

## Problem Description
- Core issue: TypeScript type mismatch in pagination structure between API response and interface definitions
- Context: GraphQL API responses include nested pagination structure that doesn't match current TypeScript interfaces
- Related systems/components: 
  - Frontend API layer (api.ts)
  - Type definitions (types.ts)
  - GraphQL queries
  - #frontend #typescript #api

## Attempted Solutions
1. [2025-01-14 09:30]
   - Approach: Updated query structure to match Strapi's standard format
   - Outcome: In progress - Modified getBlogPosts query to use correct structure
   - Learnings: Strapi expects `data` and `meta` structure instead of `nodes` and `pageInfo`
   - Impact: Need to update all queries to match this pattern
   - [[Link to changes](../../frontend/src/lib/api.ts)]

2. [2025-01-14 10:15]
   - Approach: Updated type definitions to match new query structure
   - Outcome: Partial success - fixed some type errors but revealed additional issues
   - Learnings: Need to update all response interfaces to match Strapi's structure
   - [[Link to changes](../../frontend/src/lib/types.ts)]

3. [2025-01-14 11:00]
   - Approach: Implemented proper parameter handling for pagination and filters
   - Outcome: Success - queries now accept correct parameter types
   - Learnings: Strapi expects JSON type for complex parameters
   - Impact: Need to update all query implementations

4. [2025-01-13 14:30]
   - Approach: Updated all GraphQL queries to use `_connection` pattern
   - Outcome: Failed - This approach was incorrect for Strapi's API design
   - Learnings: Strapi doesn't use connection pattern, uses data/meta instead
   - Impact: Need to revert these changes and use correct structure

5. [2025-01-13 14:00]
   - Approach: Tested updated pagination structure with GraphQL API
   - Outcome: Failed - GraphQL 400 error due to incorrect query structure
   - Learnings: Initial assumption about connection pattern was wrong
   - Impact: Led to discovery of correct Strapi query structure

2. [2025-01-13 10:00]
   - Approach: Updated interface definitions to match API response structure
   - Outcome: Partial success - fixed some type errors but revealed additional mismatches
   - Learnings: Need to ensure consistent pagination structure across all response types
   - [[Link to changes](../../frontend/src/lib/types.ts)]

2. [2025-01-13 10:12]
   - Approach: Modified response transformations to match PaginationMeta interface
   - Outcome: In progress - updating all API functions to maintain consistent structure
   - Learnings: Need to update both interface definitions and response handling
   - [[Link to changes](../../frontend/src/lib/api.ts)]

3. [2025-01-13 11:30]
   - Approach: Updated isPaginatedResponse type guard to include nodes property
   - Outcome: Fixed TypeScript error in normalizers.ts
   - Learnings: Type guards need to validate complete response structure including nodes array
   - [[Link to changes](../../frontend/src/lib/normalizers.ts)]
