# Problem Resolution Log

## Problem ID: 2025-01-005
**Date:** 2025-01-14  
**Status:** Active  
**Type:** Email Configuration  
**Priority:** High  
**Impact:** Backup notifications not being delivered

## Problem Description
Email notifications for PostgreSQL backups are failing to deliver due to SMTP connection issues. Unable to establish connection to maasiso.nl mail server on both SSL (465) and TLS (587) ports.

## Symptoms
1. Connection timeouts when attempting to send mail
2. No email notifications being received
3. Mail queue showing deferred messages
4. Log entries showing connection failures

## Log Evidence
```log
Jan 14 12:20:33 srv692111 postfix/smtp[47243]: connect to maasiso.nl[76.76.21.21]:465: Connection timed out
Jan 14 12:20:33 srv692111 postfix/smtp[47243]: 83D18C8581: to=<alerts@maasiso.nl>, relay=none, delay=30, delays=0.03/0.08/30/0, dsn=4.4.1, status=deferred
```

## Investigation Steps
1. Attempted direct connection to maasiso.nl:465 (SSL)
   - Result: Connection timeout
   - Log: Connection refused on port 465

2. Attempted connection to maasiso.nl:587 (TLS)
   - Result: Connection timeout
   - Log: Connection refused on port 587

3. Attempted connection to mail.maasiso.nl:587
   - Result: Connection timeout
   - Log: Connection refused on port 587

4. Checked Cloud86 documentation
   - Found SMTP server settings
   - Confirmed ports 465 and 587 should be available

## Current Status
- Backup script working correctly
- Email notifications failing
- SMTP connection issues unresolved
- Investigating alternative solutions

## Attempted Solutions
1. SSL Configuration (Port 465)
```bash
postconf -e 'relayhost = [maasiso.nl]:465'
postconf -e 'smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt'
postconf -e 'smtp_tls_wrappermode = yes'
```
Result: Failed - Connection timeout

2. TLS Configuration (Port 587)
```bash
postconf -e 'relayhost = [maasiso.nl]:587'
postconf -e 'smtp_use_tls = yes'
postconf -e 'smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous'
```
Result: Failed - Connection timeout

3. Alternative Hostname
```bash
postconf -e 'relayhost = [mail.maasiso.nl]:587'
```
Result: Failed - Connection timeout

## Solution
Email server is now operational on hosting platform with direct access to domain email addresses (@maasiso.nl).

## Next Steps
1. Update configuration to use hosting email server
2. Configure backend to use domain email addresses
3. Test email delivery
4. Document final configuration
