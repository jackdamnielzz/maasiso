## 2025-01-21: Page Content Type and API Integration Issues

### Current Status (Updated 2025-01-21 22:08)
- Fixed component type mapping issues between Strapi and frontend
- Successfully handling prefixed component types (e.g., 'page-blocks.text-block')
- Page content is now being properly normalized and rendered
- Fixed PerformanceMonitor component by integrating with monitoringService
- Added comprehensive documentation in [COMPONENT_NORMALIZATION_AND_RENDERING_GUIDE.md](./manuals/COMPONENT_NORMALIZATION_AND_RENDERING_GUIDE.md)

### Resolved Issues

1. Component Type Mapping:
- Fixed handling of prefixed component types from Strapi (e.g., 'page-blocks.text-block')
- Updated normalizer to properly handle component type conversion
- Components are now correctly identified and rendered

2. PerformanceMonitor Integration:
- Fixed getMetrics error by properly integrating with monitoringService
- Made getRating method public to allow metric rating calculation
- Implemented dynamic metrics update using monitoringService data

### API Request Evolution
1. Initial attempt: Used nested populate structure with multiple parameters
2. Second attempt: Simplified to basic comma-separated populate fields
3. Both attempts resulted in 400 Bad Request errors

### Observations
1. The page exists in Strapi with correct slug "page"
2. API is consistently rejecting the request format
3. Need to investigate Strapi's API documentation for correct query format

2. Performance Monitor Error:
```
Uncaught TypeError: getMetrics is not a function
    at PerformanceMonitor.useEffect.interval
```

2. Component Registry Issues:
- Mismatch between Strapi component types and frontend component mapping
- Component types from Strapi are prefixed with 'page-blocks.' but frontend expects unprefixed types
- Example: Strapi sends 'page-blocks.hero' but frontend looks for 'hero'

### Related Components
1. Page Content Type in Strapi:
- Title (Text)
- Slug (UID)
- seoTitle (Text)
- seoDescription (Text)
- seoKeywords (Text)
- featuredImage (Media)
- layout (Dynamic zone with components)
- publicationDate (DateTime)

2. Page Template Content Type:
- name (Text)
- description (Rich text)
- layout (Dynamic zone)
- category (Enumeration)
- isDefault (Boolean)

### Current Implementation Issues
1. API Population:
- Initial implementation used comma-separated populate parameter which caused validation errors
- Need to use nested populate structure for complex relationships

2. Component Mapping:
- ComponentRegistry needs to handle prefixed component types
- Current switch statement doesn't match incoming component types

### Next Steps
1. Fix API populate parameter structure
2. Update ComponentRegistry to handle prefixed component types
3. Verify component mapping between Strapi and frontend
4. Test page fetching and rendering with corrected implementation

### Technical Details
- Frontend running on: http://localhost:3002
- Strapi API endpoint: http://153.92.223.23:1337/api
- Current page slug being tested: "page"
