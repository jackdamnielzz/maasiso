# Current Issue Investigation - Environment and Routing Problems

## Issue Overview
We are currently experiencing several interconnected issues in the Next.js application:

1. Environment Variables Loading
   - Environment variables not consistently available despite being defined
   - Affects API client configuration and site-wide settings
   - Impact: Critical, blocking API functionality and content loading

2. Next.js Routing Conflicts
   - Conflicts between dynamic [slug] routes and static pages
   - 404 errors when accessing certain pages
   - Impact: High, affecting page navigation and content display

3. API Client Configuration
   - Import path issues with cache-related functions
   - Potential circular dependencies
   - Impact: High, affecting data fetching and caching

## Initial Response
Date: [Current Date]

### Immediate Actions Taken:
1. Created next.config.js with environment configuration
2. Implemented .env.local for local development
3. Fixed API client import paths
4. Modified dynamic route parameter handling

### Current Status:
- Environment variables loading mechanism in place but not fully functional
- API client imports fixed but routing issues persist
- Dynamic route parameter handling improved but conflicts remain

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Environment Variable Analysis
- Verified presence of .env and .env.local files
- Confirmed proper NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefixes
- Checked Next.js configuration for environment handling
- Identified potential loading order issues

### 2. Routing System Analysis
- Examined [slug] route implementation
- Reviewed route handling in next.config.js
- Identified conflicts between app and pages directories
- Analyzed dynamic parameter handling

### 3. API Client Review
- Checked import paths and dependencies
- Reviewed cache implementation
- Examined API client initialization
- Verified environment variable usage

## Proposed Solutions

### Environment Variables
1. Implement runtime configuration validation
2. Add environment variable debug endpoint
3. Consolidate environment configuration in one place
4. Add fallback values for critical variables

### Routing
1. Separate concerns between app and pages directories
2. Implement proper route constraints
3. Add route handling middleware
4. Improve error handling for 404 cases

### API Client
1. Restructure import hierarchy
2. Implement proper dependency injection
3. Add better error handling
4. Improve cache configuration

## Next Steps
1. Implement environment variable validation
2. Add route constraints in next.config.js
3. Restructure API client imports
4. Add comprehensive error handling

### 2024-01-06: Batch Testing Response Format and Timer Issues

**Problem Description:**
1. Response Format Mismatch
   - Batch timing tests were using incorrect response format
   - Mock responses didn't match the format expected by RequestQueue
   - Caused "Invalid response format" errors in tests

2. Timer Handling Issues
   - Inconsistent use of Jest timers in tests
   - Race conditions due to mixing real and fake timers
   - Unreliable test behavior with async operations

**Root Causes:**
1. Response Format
   - Mock implementation returned `{ data: [{ id, result }] }`
   - Queue expected `{ data: [{ data: { id, value } }] }`
   - Lack of standardization in mock response formats

2. Timer Issues
   - Incomplete timer cleanup between tests
   - Inconsistent timer handling across test cases
   - Missing proper handling of microtasks

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Response Format Standardization
   - Updated mock response format to match queue expectations
   - Added explicit response validation in tests
   - Standardized response structure across all tests

2. Timer Handling Improvements
   - Added consistent use of `jest.runAllTimers()`
   - Properly handled microtasks in async operations
   - Maintained consistent timer state throughout tests

3. Test Assertions
   - Added explicit format validation
   - Enhanced error case testing
   - Improved assertion messages

**Current Status:**
- All batch timing tests passing consistently
- Response format standardized across tests
- Timer handling reliable and consistent
- Test assertions properly validate response structure

**Learnings:**
1. Mock Response Format
   - Always validate mock formats against actual implementation
   - Document expected response formats
   - Use type checking for response structures

2. Timer Management
   - Use consistent timer handling throughout test suite
   - Always cleanup timers properly
   - Handle both macrotasks and microtasks

3. Test Design
   - Add explicit format validation
   - Test both success and error cases
   - Maintain consistent testing patterns

1. Create reusable mock response factories
2. Add response format type definitions
3. Implement comprehensive timer utilities
4. Add integration test coverage

### 2024-01-21: Environment Variable Access Fix

**Problem Description:**

   - API requests failing due to undefined env object
   - Error: "Failed to fetch page: env is not defined"
   - Affecting client-side API calls and authentication

- Environment variables not properly exposed to client components
- Strapi token not accessible in client-side code
- Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for client-accessible variables
