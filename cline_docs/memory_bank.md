# Memory Bank Status

## Current Project State
The project is a Next.js frontend application deployed on VPS2 (147.93.62.188) that interacts with a Strapi CMS on VPS1 (153.92.223.23). We are currently working on improving the development workflow and resolving authentication issues.

## Recent Activities

### Development Workflow Improvements
1. Created synchronization scripts:
   - sync.ps1 for downloading production files
   - deploy.ps1 for deployment
   - Progress indicators added
   - Error handling implemented

2. Environment Management:
   - Synchronized .env files
   - Configured build settings
   - Added production optimizations

### Authentication Attempts
1. SSH Key Authentication:
   - Generated RSA key pair
   - Attempted key deployment
   - Faced permission issues

2. Token Management:
   - Implemented environment variable handling
   - Added token validation
   - Experiencing 401 errors

## Current Challenges

### Critical Issues
1. Authentication:
   - Build process failing with 401 errors
   - Token validation issues
   - Environment variable problems

2. File System:
   - Permission issues during sync
   - File locking problems
   - Directory access errors

### Attempted Solutions
1. Authentication:
   ```powershell
   # SSH key generation
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   
   # Automated password handling
   $pinfo.RedirectStandardInput = $true
   ```

2. File System:
   ```powershell
   # Directory handling
   Set-Location $LOCAL_PATH
   Remove-Item -Path $TEMP_DIR -Recurse -Force
   ```

## Next Actions

### Immediate Tasks
1. Authentication:
   - Implement token refresh
   - Add retry logic
   - Improve error handling

2. Build Process:
   - Add validation steps
   - Implement progressive deployment
   - Add rollback capability

### Future Improvements
1. Infrastructure:
   - Load balancing
   - CDN integration
   - Monitoring system

2. Development:
   - Automated testing
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Documentation automation

## Documentation Status

### Updated Documents
- systemPatterns.md: Architecture and patterns
- progress.md: Current progress and tasks
- currentTask.md: Active development focus
- project_handover.md: Comprehensive project summary

### Pending Updates
- Troubleshooting guides
- Error recovery procedures
- Performance optimization docs

## Technical Context

### Environment Configuration
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api/proxy
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://maasiso.nl
STRAPI_URL=http://153.92.223.23:1337
```

### Build Configuration
```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  output: 'standalone',
  typescript: {
    tsconfigPath: './tsconfig.prod.json'
  }
}
```

## Last Known State
- Authentication: Failing with 401 errors
- Build Process: Static generation issues
- File System: Permission problems
- Documentation: 90% complete
- Scripts: Working with manual intervention

## Recovery Points
1. Working Configuration:
   - Basic file synchronization
   - Environment variable handling
   - Build process automation

2. Failed Attempts:
   - SSH key authentication
   - Automated password handling
   - Token refresh mechanism

## Next Steps After Reset
1. Review authentication logs
2. Check token validity
3. Verify environment variables
4. Test build process
5. Update documentation
