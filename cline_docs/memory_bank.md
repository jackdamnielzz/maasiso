# Memory Bank Status

## Current Project State
The project is a Next.js frontend application deployed on VPS2 (147.93.62.188) that interacts with a Strapi CMS on VPS1 (153.92.223.23). We have successfully fixed the contact form functionality and improved the deployment process for handling environment variables.

## Recent Activities

### Contact Form Fixes & Deployment Improvements
1. Fixed contact form issues on production:
   - Identified and fixed email authentication problems
   - Resolved environment variable issues in deployment
   - Added detailed error logging and diagnostics
   - Confirmed successful email sending capability

2. Deployment Workflow Improvements:
   - Enhanced direct-deploy.ps1 script
   - Fixed environment variable handling during deployment
   - Added proper NODE_ENV=production setting
   - Created safer .env file generation on server
   - Added file permissions handling (chmod 600)

3. Environment Management:
   - Improved environment variable handling
   - Fixed issue with EMAIL_PASSWORD not being set correctly
   - Created diagnostic test endpoint for environment verification
   - Added comprehensive documentation of the solutions

### Authentication Attempts
1. SSH Key Authentication:
   - Generated RSA key pair
   - Attempted key deployment
   - Faced permission issues

2. Token Management:
   - Implemented environment variable handling
   - Added token validation
   - Experiencing 401 errors

## Current Challenges

### Resolved Issues
1. Contact Form Functionality:
   - Email sending in production environment now working correctly
   - SMTP authentication fixed by properly setting EMAIL_PASSWORD
   - Production mode ensured by setting NODE_ENV=production
   - Environment variable persistence fixed in deployment script

2. Deployment Process:
   - Environment variable handling improved
   - Production/development environment distinction enforced
   - Secure handling of sensitive credentials implemented
   - File permissions properly set for security

### Current Solutions Implemented
1. Environment Variable Management:
   ```bash
   # Create a production .env file with correct settings
   cat > /var/www/jouw-frontend-website/.env << EOL
   NODE_ENV=production
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://147.93.62.188:3000
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://147.93.62.187:1337
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=******
   EOL

   # Make sure the file has correct permissions
   chmod 600 /var/www/jouw-frontend-website/.env
   ```

2. Diagnostic Tools:
   ```typescript
   // Test endpoint for verifying environment variables
   export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
     return NextResponse.json({
       success: true,
       environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
       debug: {
         emailPasswordSet: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD ? true : false,
         timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
       }
     });
   }
   ```

## Next Actions

### Immediate Tasks
1. Authentication:
   - Implement token refresh
   - Add retry logic
   - Improve error handling

2. Build Process:
   - Add validation steps
   - Implement progressive deployment
   - Add rollback capability

### Future Improvements
1. Infrastructure:
   - Load balancing
   - CDN integration
   - Monitoring system

2. Development:
   - Automated testing
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Documentation automation

## Documentation Status

### Updated Documents
- activeContext.md: Current work context and contact form fixes
- progress.md: Updated progress (95% complete) and contact form status
- vps_deployment_setup.md: Improved deployment instructions for environment handling
- technical_issues/contact_form_environment_issue.md: Detailed documentation of the issue and solution
- memory_bank.md: Updated memory bank with current status

### New Documentation Created
- contact_form_environment_issue.md: Detailed troubleshooting documentation of contact form fixes
- Test endpoint for environment verification (app/api/contact-test/route.ts)
- Updated deployment scripts documentation with environment handling best practices

## Technical Context

### Environment Configuration
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api/proxy
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://maasiso.nl
STRAPI_URL=http://153.92.223.23:1337
```

### Build Configuration
```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  output: 'standalone',
  typescript: {
    tsconfigPath: './tsconfig.prod.json'
  }
}
```
## Last Known State
- Contact Form: Working correctly in production with email functionality
- Environment Variables: Correctly configured with EMAIL_PASSWORD and NODE_ENV
- Authentication: Still experiencing issues with 401 errors (to be addressed)
- Build Process: Fixed deployment script issues with environment variables
- Documentation: 95% complete, including new contact form issue documentation
- Deployment Script: Enhanced with proper environment variable handling

## Recovery Points
1. Working Configuration:
   - Contact form with email sending capability
   - Environment variable handling during deployment
   - Direct deployment script with proper .env configuration
   - Test endpoint for environment verification

2. Resolved Issues:
   - Email sending in production environment
   - SMTP authentication with proper PASSWORD
   - NODE_ENV=production setting
   - Deployment script environment variable handling

## Next Steps After Reset
1. Test the contact form functionality on production
2. Verify environment variables are correctly set
3. Check email sending capability
4. Review updated documentation about the contact form fixes
5. Use the test endpoint (/api/contact-test) to verify environment variables if needed
5. Update documentation
