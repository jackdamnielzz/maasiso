# Error Log Archives

This directory contains archived error logs from the main errorLog.md file. The archival process helps maintain a manageable size for the active error log while preserving historical error records for future reference.

## Archival Process

The error logs are kept small and manageable by following these rules:

1. **Maximum Entries:** Each error log file contains a maximum of 3 errors
2. **File Naming:** Archive files are named using the format: `error_log_YYYY_MM_N.md` where N is a sequential number (e.g., error_log_2025_01_1.md)
3. **When to Create New File:** As soon as a log contains 3 errors and a new error needs to be documented, create a new file
4. **File Organization:**
   - The main errorLog.md is always the current active file
   - When it reaches 3 errors, rename it to the archive format and create a new errorLog.md
   - All files maintain the same structure and formatting

This approach ensures:
- Each file is concise and easy to read
- Quick access to error history through small, focused files
- Simple chronological organization

## Archive File Structure
Each archive file follows the same structure as the main error log:
- Date and error type
- Description and impact
- Resolution and timeline
- Related documentation links

## Guidelines
- Never delete error entries - always archive them
- Maintain chronological order within archive files
- Include clear references to related documentation
- Preserve all metadata and context from original entries

## Searching Archives
To find specific historical errors:
1. Check the date of the error you're looking for
2. Open the corresponding archive file
3. Use text search within the file
4. Reference the main errorLog.md for links to related documentation
