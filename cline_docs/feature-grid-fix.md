# Feature Grid Component Fix

## Issue
The feature grid component on the diensten page was not displaying properly because the features data was not being correctly fetched from Strapi. The console logs showed that the feature grid component was being found in the Strapi response, but it didn't have any features data:

```
[Feature Extraction] Raw component structure: {
  id: 51,
  type: 'page-blocks.feature-grid',
  hasFeatures: false,
  featuresType: 'undefined',
  isArray: false,
  hasData: false
}
[Feature Extraction] No valid features structure found, returning empty array
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `getPage` function in `src/lib/api.ts`. The function was using a simple populate parameter (`populate=*`) which doesn't deeply populate nested relationships like the features in a feature grid component.

```typescript
const simplePopulate = 'populate=*';
const directUrl = `${strapiUrl}/api/pages?filters[slug][$eq]=${slug}&${simplePopulate}&${cacheBuster}`;
```

In contrast, the test endpoint (`app/api/test-feature-grid/route.ts`) was using a more specific populate parameter that correctly fetched the nested features:

```typescript
const response = await fetch(`${strapiUrl}/api/pages?filters[slug][$eq]=diensten&populate[layout][populate]=*`, {
```

## Solution
The solution was to update the `getPage` function to use a more appropriate populate parameter that correctly fetches the nested features:

```typescript
const simplePopulate = 'populate[layout][populate]=*';
const directUrl = `${strapiUrl}/api/pages?filters[slug][$eq]=${slug}&${simplePopulate}&${cacheBuster}`;
```

Additionally, we updated the indexed populate parameters to include the features.link field:

```typescript
const indexedPopulate = [
  'populate[0]=layout',
  'populate[1]=layout.features',
  'populate[2]=layout.features.icon',
  'populate[5]=layout.features.link',
  'populate[3]=layout.backgroundImage',
  'populate[4]=layout.ctaButton'
].join('&');
```

## Verification
After making these changes, we verified that the feature grid component was now correctly displaying on the diensten page. The console logs confirmed that the features were being properly extracted:

```
[Feature Extraction] Raw component structure: {
  id: 51,
  type: 'page-blocks.feature-grid',
  hasFeatures: true,
  featuresType: 'object',
  isArray: true,
  hasData: false
}
[Feature Extraction] Found direct array with 6 items
[Feature Extraction] Extracted 6 features
```

We also visually confirmed that the feature grid was displaying on the page by launching a browser and navigating to the diensten page.

## Lessons Learned
1. When working with Strapi, it's important to use the correct populate parameters to fetch nested relationships.
2. The `populate=*` parameter doesn't deeply populate nested relationships, so more specific populate parameters are needed for complex data structures.
3. Testing endpoints can be a valuable resource for understanding how to correctly fetch data from Strapi.
