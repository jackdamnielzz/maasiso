# Project Status Report - April 9, 2025

## 1. Recent Accomplishments

### RSC Implementation Fixes
- Resolved React Hydration Error #418 on `/news` page
- Fixed RSC fetch failures for routes with `_rsc` parameters
- Corrected TypeError issues from mismatched data structures
- Reference: [RSC Debugging Documentation](rsc-debugging-2025-04-09.md)

### Deployment Process Improvements
- Implemented correct Next.js standalone mode configuration
- Fixed PM2 working directory issues
- Established proper file permissions and ownership
- Reference: [Deployment Guide](deployment-guide.md)

### Logging Implementation
- Added comprehensive diagnostic logging across all layers:
  * Server components (app/news/page.tsx)
  * Client components (NewsPageClient.tsx, NewsPageClientWrapper.tsx)
  * API layer (src/lib/api.ts)

## 2. Current System State

### Deployment Configuration
- Next.js standalone mode properly configured with correct directory structure
- PM2 setup with accurate working directory (.next/standalone)
- Proper file permissions and ownership established
- Critical files correctly placed and accessible

### Component Architecture
- Clear server/client component boundaries established
- Structured data flow between components
- RSC implementation with proper serialization
- Improved error handling and type checking

### System Integration
- Nginx configuration optimized for performance
- PM2 process management properly configured
- Health check endpoints implemented
- Backup systems in place

## 3. Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Implemented Logging Points
- Server-side component logging:
  * API request parameters
  * Response validation
  * Data structure verification
- Client-side component logging:
  * Props validation
  * State updates
  * Data processing steps
- API layer logging:
  * Request details
  * Response status
  * Data structure validation

### Key Metrics Being Tracked
- API response times and status codes
- Data structure integrity
- Component rendering performance
- Server/client state synchronization
- Resource usage and availability

### Log Access and Interpretation
- Application logs: /var/www/jouw-frontend-website/logs/
- PM2 logs: ~/.pm2/logs/
- Nginx logs: /var/log/nginx/
- Monitoring commands available in deployment guide

## 4. Known Issues and Next Steps

### Remaining RSC Concerns
- Monitor for any new RSC fetch failures
- Watch for hydration mismatches
- Verify data serialization in edge cases

### Areas Needing Monitoring
- Component rehydration performance
- API response patterns
- Static asset loading
- Process memory usage

### Suggested Improvements
- Further refine data validation
- Enhance error handling
- Investigate edge cases in RSC serialization
- Optimize static asset delivery

## 5. Documentation Status

### Updated Documentation
- RSC debugging documentation (rsc-debugging-2025-04-09.md)
- Deployment guide with standalone mode details (deployment-guide.md)
- Logging implementation details
- Monitoring and maintenance procedures

### Cross-References
- RSC debugging linked to deployment configuration
- Logging implementation tied to monitoring procedures
- Component architecture documentation connected to deployment guide

### Documentation Needs
- Additional monitoring dashboards documentation
- Performance optimization guidelines
- Error recovery procedures
- Long-term maintenance planning
