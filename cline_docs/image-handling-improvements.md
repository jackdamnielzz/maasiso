# Image Handling Improvements

## Changes Made (March 17, 2025)

### 1. Proxy Route Implementation
- Fixed the proxy route in `app/api/proxy/assets/[...path]/route.ts`
- Removed duplicate fetch attempts
- Added proper caching headers
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added support for various image formats
- Implemented proper CORS headers

### 2. Image URL Handling
- Updated `src/lib/utils/imageUtils.ts` with improved URL transformation
- Added support for both normalized Image and StrapiMedia types
- Improved format handling for different image sizes (thumbnail, small, medium, large)
- Added proper type safety and validation
- Fixed issues with Strapi URL handling

### 3. OptimizedImage Component
- Updated to handle both direct URLs and Strapi media objects
- Improved error handling with proper fallbacks
- Added support for different image formats
- Enhanced accessibility with proper ARIA attributes
- Added loading states and error states

## Testing Instructions

1. News Article Images:
   - Verify images load correctly in news article cards
   - Check different image formats (thumbnail, small) load properly
   - Verify fallback image appears when image fails to load

2. Blog Post Images:
   - Verify featured images load correctly
   - Check image formats and sizes are correct
   - Verify proxy route handles image requests properly

3. Error Cases:
   - Test with missing images (should show fallback)
   - Test with invalid URLs (should handle gracefully)
   - Test with different image formats (should select appropriate size)

## Next Steps

1. Monitor image loading performance
2. Consider implementing image optimization at the proxy level
3. Add support for responsive images based on device size
4. Consider implementing image lazy loading for performance
5. Add automated tests for image handling components

## Technical Details

### Image URL Transformation Flow
1. Check if URL is null/undefined → return fallback
2. Check if data/blob URL → return as is
3. Check if absolute URL (non-Strapi) → return as is
4. Check if already proxy path → return as is
5. Clean and transform path → return proxied URL

### Supported Image Formats
- thumbnail: Small preview images
- small: Default size for cards and previews
- medium: Content images
- large: Featured images

### Error Handling Strategy
1. Component level: Shows fallback UI
2. Proxy level: Returns appropriate error responses
3. URL level: Validates and transforms URLs safely

### Caching Strategy
- Client-side: 1 year cache for immutable assets
- Proxy: Passes through Strapi's cache headers
- Browser: Uses standard cache control headers
