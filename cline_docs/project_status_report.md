# Comprehensive Project Status Report - MaasISO Website Development

## Current Situation

We are developing a professional website for MaasISO consultancy using a modern tech stack:
- Frontend: Next.js 13+ with App Router and TypeScript
- Backend: Self-hosted Strapi CMS (v5.7.0) with PostgreSQL
- API: GraphQL for type-safe data fetching
- Hosting: VPS (Hostinger KVM1) for backend, Vercel for frontend

### Active Development Focus

We're currently enhancing the event management functionality by implementing registration and early bird discount features. This involves both backend and frontend changes:

1. Backend Changes (Just Completed):
```typescript
// Event Content Type Schema
{
  registrationEnabled: boolean;  // Toggle event registration
  earlyBirdDiscount: {
    enabled: boolean;
    discountAmount: decimal;
    endDate: datetime;
  };
  endTime: datetime;
}
```

2. Frontend Updates (Next Phase):
- Need to update GraphQL types
- Implement new UI components for registration
- Add early bird pricing display

### Related Components
This work ties into several key areas:
1. Event listing page
2. Event detail page
3. Registration system
4. Payment integration (future phase)

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Strapi Production Mode
**Problem:** Needed to modify content types while Strapi was in production mode, which is normally locked for safety.

**Solution Implementation:**
1. Created backup:
```bash
pg_dump strapi_db > /var/lib/postgresql/strapi_backup.sql
```

2. Switched to development mode:
```bash
pm2 stop strapi
NODE_ENV=development npm run develop
```

3. Made content type changes
4. Rebuilt and redeployed:
```bash
npm run build
pm2 start strapi
```

**Logs from Implementation:**
```
[2025-01-12 20:10:35.531] info: File changed: /var/www/strapi/src/api/event/content-types/event/schema.json
[2025-01-12 20:10:35.708] info: File created: /var/www/strapi/src/components/event-settings/early-bird-discount.json
```

### Challenge 2: Component Architecture
Created a reusable "event-settings" component category for future extensibility. This allows us to:
- Group related fields logically
- Maintain consistent data structure
- Enable reuse across content types

## Current Project State

### Recently Completed
1. Backend:
   - Event content type enhancement
   - Database backup system
   - Component architecture setup

2. Frontend:
   - Blog system implementation
   - Dynamic routing with Next.js App Router
   - Error handling system
   - Loading states

### In Progress
1. Frontend Types Update:
```typescript
// TODO: Update types to include new fields
interface Event {
  registrationEnabled: boolean;
  earlyBirdDiscount?: {
    enabled: boolean;
    discountAmount: number;
    endDate: Date;
  };
  endTime: Date;
}
```

2. GraphQL Schema Updates:
```graphql
# TODO: Add new fields to queries
query GetEvent($id: ID!) {
  event(id: $id) {
    registrationEnabled
    earlyBirdDiscount {
      enabled
      discountAmount
      endDate
    }
    endTime
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Immediate Tasks:
   - Update frontend TypeScript interfaces
   - Modify GraphQL queries
   - Implement registration UI components

2. Short-term Goals:
   - Complete event management system
   - Implement search functionality
   - Enhance mobile responsiveness

3. Medium-term Goals:
   - Payment integration
   - User authentication
   - Admin dashboard

## Important Context for Continuation

### Environment Details
- Backend: http://153.92.223.23/admin
- Database: PostgreSQL (strapi_db)
- Current branch: main

### Critical Files
1. Content Types:
   - `/var/www/strapi/src/api/event/content-types/event/schema.json`
   - `/var/www/strapi/src/components/event-settings/early-bird-discount.json`

2. Frontend Components (to be updated):
   - `frontend/src/components/features/EventCard.tsx`
   - `frontend/src/components/features/EventDetails.tsx`

### Development Guidelines
1. Always backup database before content type changes
2. Test changes in development mode first
3. Update documentation with any schema changes
4. Maintain Dutch language support throughout

## Conclusion

The event management enhancement is progressing well, with backend changes completed and frontend updates next in line. The immediate focus should be on implementing the frontend changes to utilize the new fields, followed by testing the complete registration flow.

Key priorities:
1. Frontend type updates
2. GraphQL query modifications
3. UI component implementation
4. End-to-end testing

This work sets the foundation for future features like payment processing and user management.
