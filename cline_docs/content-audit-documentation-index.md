### 8. Progress Documentation

**File:** `cline_docs/progress.md`

This document tracks the progress of the project, including:
- Completed features
- Current functionality status
- Next development priorities

## Code Changes

### 1. API Data Fetching (src/lib/api.ts)

- Modified the `getPage` function to use a more appropriate populate parameter (`populate[layout][populate]=*`) that correctly fetches nested relationships
- Updated the indexed populate parameters to include the features.link field
- Fixed an issue where the feature grid component was not displaying properly because the features data was not being correctly fetched from Strapi

### 2. Diensten Page (app/diensten/page.tsx)

- Removed the entire `fallbackFeatures` array
- Replaced extensive fallback content with a simple error message
- Simplified the fallback rendering to match the approach used in over-ons page

### 3. Over-ons Page (app/over-ons/page.tsx)

- Modified the page-blocks.button component to use data from Strapi
- Added fallback values for title and description that only apply when Strapi data is missing
- Fixed syntax issues in the template literals

### 4. Test Script (scripts/test-content-dynamic.js)

- Created a test script to verify that pages are correctly fetching and displaying content from Strapi
- The script tests both the diensten and over-ons pages to ensure they display dynamic content when Strapi data is available and fallback content when Strapi data is unavailable

## Testing and Verification

### 1. Automated Testing

- Created a test script (`scripts/test-content-dynamic.js`) to verify dynamic content loading
- The script checks if pages are displaying dynamic content from Strapi
- The script verifies that the feature grid component is displaying all features

### 2. Manual Testing

- Visually verified that the feature grid component displays correctly on the diensten page
- Confirmed that all 6 features are being properly extracted and displayed
- Checked the console logs to confirm that features are being properly extracted
- Verified that both pages display content fetched from Strapi
- Tested error handling by temporarily using an invalid Strapi URL

## Conclusion

The content audit and cleanup task has been successfully completed. The diensten and over-ons pages now only display content that is directly fetched from Strapi, with the exception of the navbar/header, footer, and subfooter. The feature grid component issue has been fixed, and all content is now being properly fetched and displayed.

The documentation created for this task provides a comprehensive overview of the audit findings, changes made, implementation details, testing procedures, and lessons learned. This documentation will be valuable for future development and maintenance of the MaasISO website.

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring for any other components that may have issues with nested data structures
2. Test all pages to verify they display the most up-to-date content from Strapi
3. Make changes in Strapi and verify they are immediately reflected on the website
4. Consider implementing a more robust approach for handling deeply nested relationships in Strapi responses
5. Develop a schema adapter to normalize Strapi responses
