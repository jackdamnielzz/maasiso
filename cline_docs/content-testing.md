   - Type definitions in progress
   - Component planning started

## Core Principles

1. Test Content Preservation
   - All test content must be preserved
   - Never delete working test content
   - Document all test content purposes
   - Version control test content schemas
   - Maintain ID type consistency

2. Change Management
   - Never modify working content types without testing
   - Always test changes with existing content
   - Document all modifications
   - Verify no regressions
   - Validate ID type handling

3. ID Type Handling
   - All IDs must be strings
   - Numeric IDs must be converted to strings
   - ID conversion must happen during normalization
   - ID type validation must be logged
   - ID handling must be tested

## Testing Procedures

### 1. Creating Test Content
a. Initial Setup:
   - Create test content in Strapi CMS
   - Document content structure
   - Save content IDs (as strings)
   - Note special test cases
   - Verify ID type handling

b. Validation:
   - Verify all required fields
   - Test optional fields
   - Check field validations
   - Test error cases
   - Validate ID types

### 2. Frontend Testing
a. Component Testing:
   - Test individual components
   - Test component combinations
   - Verify responsive behavior
   - Check error states
   - Verify ID handling

b. Integration Testing:
   - Test API responses
   - Verify data normalization
   - Check error handling
   - Test loading states
   - Validate ID conversion

### 3. Regression Testing
a. Before Changes:
   - Document current behavior
   - Create test snapshots
   - Note critical paths
   - Record performance metrics
   - Document ID handling

b. After Changes:
   - Verify existing content
   - Check all test cases
   - Validate performance
   - Document results
   - Verify ID consistency

## Change Management Protocol

### 1. Adding New Features
a. Requirements:
   - Create new test content
   - Document test cases
   - Update type definitions
   - Add validation tests
   - Implement ID handling

b. Verification:
   - Test new features
   - Verify existing features
   - Check performance impact
   - Update documentation
   - Validate ID types

### 2. Modifying Existing Features
a. Pre-modification:
   - Document current state
   - Create backup content
   - Note dependencies
   - Plan test strategy
   - Record ID handling

b. Post-modification:
   - Test modifications
   - Verify no regressions
   - Update documentation
   - Record changes
   - Verify ID consistency

## Error Prevention

### 1. Common Pitfalls
- Modifying shared components without testing
- Deleting test content
- Changing field types without migration
- Forgetting to update documentation
- Using numeric IDs instead of strings
- Not converting IDs during normalization
- Missing ID validation in type guards

### 2. Best Practices
- Always create test content first
- Document all test cases
- Verify frontend rendering
- Test error scenarios
- Keep documentation updated
- Convert IDs to strings during normalization
- Add ID validation in type guards
- Log ID validation failures
