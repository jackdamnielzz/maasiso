# Strapi Connection Issues Resolution
Date: March 17, 2025

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Installed date-fns
   - Installed sharp with platform-specific build
   - Installed pg for PostgreSQL support

2. **CORS Configuration**
   - Updated middlewares.js to allow connections from:
     * http://147.93.62.188
     * http://147.93.62.188:3000
     * http://localhost:3000

3. **Server Binding**
   - Updated .env to bind to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
   - Confirmed port 1337 is being used

## Current Status
- Strapi is running successfully
- Database connection is established (PostgreSQL)
- Server is accessible on port 1337
