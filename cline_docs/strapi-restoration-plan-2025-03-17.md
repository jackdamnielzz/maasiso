# Strapi Restoration Plan - March 17, 2025

## Current Status and Issues

- The Strapi admin interface (http://153.92.223.23:1337/admin) is accessible but shows no content
- The database (strapi_db) exists and is connected, but appears to be empty
- We found several backup options:
  - `/root/strapi_backup.sql` (0 bytes, not usable)
  - `/backups/strapi_db_pre_changes.sql` (449KB, valid PostgreSQL dump)
  - Daily uploads backups in `/var/backups/strapi` (all 45 bytes, likely empty)
- The Users & Permissions plugin is showing 404 errors (/users-permissions/roles)
- Errors in logs about "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pluginOptions')"
- Frontend making API requests but receiving 401 (Unauthorized) errors

## What We've Tried So Far

- Created a new API token through the Strapi admin interface
- Added the token to both Strapi's .env file and the frontend's .env.production
- Attempted to configure permissions through the admin UI but encountered issues
- Tried to access the Users & Permissions section but got 404 errors
- Attempted to restart the Strapi service multiple times
- Checked database connectivity and configuration

## Identified Problems

- Permission issues when trying to restore the backup
- The Users & Permissions plugin appears to be malfunctioning
- The database is empty, missing the original content
- API authentication is not working properly despite having a valid token
- The pluginOptions error suggests potential plugin configuration issues

## Restoration Plan

### 1. Database Restoration
- Restore from the valid backup at `/backups/strapi_db_pre_changes.sql`
- Handle permission issues during restoration
- Verify data integrity after restoration

### 2. Plugin Fixes
- Reinstall the Users & Permissions plugin
- Verify plugin configurations
- Check for any corrupted plugin data

### 3. Permission Configuration
- Once plugins are working, properly set up public role permissions
- Configure API token permissions
- Test API access with the token

### 4. Content Verification
- After database restoration, verify all content types
- Check if content is accessible through the admin interface
- Test API endpoints for content retrieval

## Potential Challenges
- Database restoration might require specific PostgreSQL permissions
- Plugin reinstallation could require additional configuration
- May need to rebuild the Strapi admin UI after fixes
- Might need to update plugin configurations manually

## Success Criteria
- Database restored with original content
- Users & Permissions plugin functioning correctly
- Public API endpoints accessible with proper authentication
- Content visible and manageable in the admin interface
- Frontend able to fetch content successfully

## Action Log

- March 17, 2025 13:40 - Initial server assessment completed
- March 17, 2025 13:41 - Identified viable backup at `/backups/strapi_db_pre_changes.sql`
