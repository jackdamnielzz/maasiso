# Test Suite Stability and Maintainability Strategy

## Context and Problem Statement

The project currently suffers from persistent and widespread test failures. Analysis reveals the use of two separate test frameworks: Jest and Vitest. This dual-framework setup introduces conflicts in environment configuration, dependency management, and module resolution, leading to instability and maintenance challenges.

## Current State Summary

- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest (primary) and Vitest (secondary, used separately).
- **Jest Configuration:** Uses next/jest integration, jsdom environment, custom setup file with global mocks.
- **Vitest:** Installed but not integrated into main test scripts; likely used for isolated tests.
- **Module Resolution:** Standard Node and path aliasing via tsconfig and jest.config.js.
- **Test Suite Structure:** Tests are not clearly separated by framework, causing potential overlap.
- **Dependency Management:** Both Jest and Vitest dependencies coexist, increasing complexity.

## Proposed New Approach

### 1. Consolidate Test Frameworks

- **Decision:** Choose a single test framework to unify the test suite.
- **Options:**
  - **Jest:** Strong Next.js support, mature ecosystem, stable.
  - **Vitest:** Modern, faster, native ESM support, growing ecosystem.
- **Recommendation:** Evaluate project priorities; if Next.js integration and ecosystem maturity are critical, choose Jest. Otherwise, consider migrating fully to Vitest for speed and modern features.

### 2. Restructure Test Suite

- Organize tests under framework-specific directories if dual frameworks must coexist temporarily.
- Migrate all tests to the chosen framework to eliminate overlap.
- Ensure test files and setup scripts are clearly scoped and isolated.

### 3. Revise Module Resolution and Transform Configuration

- Align `tsconfig.json`, test framework config (jest.config.js or vitest.config.ts), and package.json scripts.
- Use consistent module systems (ESM or CJS) across the project.
- Configure transforms and mocks to suit the chosen framework.

### 4. Dependency Management

- Remove unused or conflicting test dependencies.
- Lock dependency versions to prevent drift.
- Use peer dependencies where appropriate to avoid duplication.

### 5. Environment Configuration and Isolation

- Standardize test environment setup.
- Avoid global mocks that interfere across tests.
- Use setup and teardown hooks to isolate tests.
- Consider containerized or sandboxed test environments if needed.

### 6. Test Isolation and Parallelization

- Use test isolation features of the chosen framework.
- Enable parallel test execution to reduce test suite runtime.
- Monitor flaky tests and address root causes.

### 7. Monitoring and Logging

- Enhance test logging to capture failure context.
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for early failure detection.
- Use test coverage tools to ensure completeness.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Framework Selection:** Conduct a brief evaluation and decide on Jest or Vitest.
2. **Dependency Cleanup:** Remove the unused framework and related dependencies.
3. **Test Migration:** Migrate all tests to the chosen framework, refactor setup files.
4. **Configuration Alignment:** Update tsconfig, test configs, and scripts.
5. **Test Suite Restructuring:** Organize tests and isolate environments.
6. **CI/CD Integration:** Update pipelines to reflect new test strategy.
7. **Monitoring Setup:** Implement enhanced logging and monitoring.
8. **Documentation:** Update project docs with new testing guidelines.

## Risks and Considerations

- Migration effort may be significant depending on test suite size.
- Temporary dual-framework coexistence may require careful isolation.
- Some test utilities or libraries may not be fully compatible with the chosen framework.
- Need to ensure developer training and documentation for the new approach.

## Conclusion

Consolidating to a single test framework and restructuring the test suite with aligned configuration and dependencies will significantly improve test stability and maintainability. This strategic approach mitigates conflicts, reduces complexity, and enables faster, more reliable testing aligned with project goals.
