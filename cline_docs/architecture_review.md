# Architecture Review - Environment Configuration Issues

## Current Issue
The blog page is experiencing environment configuration issues where the required environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is not being properly loaded, despite being defined in `.env.local`. This causes the page to briefly show content before failing.

## Analysis

### Environment Setup
- Environment variables are properly defined in `.env.local`
- The application uses a robust environment validation system in `src/lib/config/env.ts`
- Next.js configuration has some structural issues that may affect environment variable loading

### Configuration Issues Identified
1. Duplicate webpack configuration in `next.config.js`
2. Duplicate experimental section
3. Explicit environment variable definition in `env` section which may interfere with automatic loading

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Next.js Configuration Updates
The `next.config.js` needs to be simplified and corrected:
- Remove duplicate webpack configuration
- Remove duplicate experimental section
- Remove explicit `env` section to allow proper automatic loading of environment variables
- Keep the essential configuration for proper functionality

### 2. Environment Variable Loading
- Verify that `.env.local` is in the correct location (frontend root directory)
- Ensure the development server is restarted after environment changes
- Consider adding environment variable validation at startup

### Implementation Plan
1. Switch to Code mode to make the necessary changes
2. Update `next.config.js` to remove duplications and potential conflicts
3. Verify environment variable loading after changes
4. Test the blog page functionality

## Technical Debt
- Consider implementing a more robust environment variable validation system at build time
- Add documentation about environment setup requirements
- Consider adding environment variable checks to the CI/CD pipeline

## Next Steps
1. Switch to Code mode to implement the configuration changes
2. Test the changes in development environment
3. Document the changes and update deployment procedures if needed
