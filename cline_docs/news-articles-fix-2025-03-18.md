# News Articles 502 Bad Gateway Investigation and Fix

## Problem Description
The news articles page (https://maasiso.nl/news) was returning 502 Bad Gateway errors in the production environment.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. Proxy Configuration Inconsistencies
   - Nginx proxy settings were not correctly configured
   - URL routing for API requests had potential mismatches

2. Timeout and Connection Issues
   - Default timeout settings were too short
   - Proxy connection settings needed optimization

## Implemented Fixes

### Nginx Configuration
- Updated proxy timeout settings from 60s to 120s
- Changed localhost binding from `http://localhost:3000` to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Added `proxy_intercept_errors on` to improve error handling

### Fetch Configuration
- Updated base URL resolution in `monitoredFetch.ts`
- Improved fallback URL handling
- Ensured consistent API routing

## Recommended Monitoring
- Monitor application logs for any persistent connection or proxy issues
- Verify news articles page loads correctly after deployment
- Check Strapi backend connectivity

## Next Steps
- Perform thorough testing of news articles page
- Monitor server performance and error logs
- Consider implementing more robust error handling if issues persist
