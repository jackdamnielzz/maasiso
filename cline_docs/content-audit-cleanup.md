# Content Audit and Cleanup for Diensten and Over-ons Pages

## Overview
This document summarizes the systematic audit and cleanup performed on the diensten and over-ons pages to ensure they only display content that is directly fetched from Strapi, with the exception of the navbar/header, footer, and subfooter.

## Audit Findings

### Diensten Page (app/diensten/page.tsx)
1. **Major Hardcoded Content Issues:**
   - Large `fallbackFeatures` array (lines 17-143) containing hardcoded feature data
   - Extensive fallback content with hardcoded hero section, feature grid, and CTA section
   - Fallback content was used when Strapi API calls failed

2. **Minor Hardcoded Content:**
   - Page metadata (title, description, keywords)
   - Minimal fallback texts for component properties (e.g., feature titles, descriptions)

### Over-ons Page (app/over-ons/page.tsx)
1. **Major Hardcoded Content Issues:**
   - Hardcoded content in the page-blocks.button component (title and description)
   - Minimal fallback content for API failures (already implemented correctly)

2. **Minor Hardcoded Content:**
   - Page metadata (title, description, keywords)
   - Minimal fallback texts for component properties

## Changes Made

### Diensten Page (app/diensten/page.tsx)
1. **Removed Hardcoded Content:**
   - Removed the entire `fallbackFeatures` array
   - Replaced extensive fallback content with a simple error message
   - Simplified the fallback rendering to match the approach used in over-ons page

2. **Retained Content:**
   - Kept page metadata (standard practice in Next.js)
   - Kept minimal fallback texts for component properties to handle edge cases

### Over-ons Page (app/over-ons/page.tsx)
1. **Updated Content:**
   - Modified the page-blocks.button component to use data from Strapi
   - Added fallback values for title and description that only apply when Strapi data is missing

2. **Retained Content:**
   - Kept page metadata
   - Kept minimal fallback texts for component properties

### API Data Fetching (src/lib/api.ts)
1. **Updated Content Fetching:**
   - Modified the `getPage` function to use a more appropriate populate parameter (`populate[layout][populate]=*`) that correctly fetches nested relationships
   - Updated the indexed populate parameters to include the features.link field
   - Fixed an issue where the feature grid component was not displaying properly because the features data was not being correctly fetched from Strapi
   - Ensured that all components, including feature grids with nested features, are properly populated from Strapi
   - See `cline_docs/feature-grid-fix.md` for detailed information about this fix

## Verification Process

### Testing Approach
1. **Dynamic Content Rendering:**
   - Both pages now attempt to fetch content from Strapi
   - Both pages display dynamic content when Strapi data is available
   - Both pages display a minimal error message when Strapi data is unavailable

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Enhanced error logging for API failures
   - Simplified fallback UI for error states

3. **Content Source Verification:**
   - All main content now comes directly from Strapi
   - Only minimal fallbacks remain for edge cases
   - No extensive hardcoded content remains

4. **Feature Grid Verification:**
   - Verified that the feature grid component on the diensten page is correctly displaying data from Strapi
   - Confirmed that all 6 features are being properly extracted and displayed
   - Visually inspected the page to ensure the feature grid is rendering correctly

## Conclusion
The diensten and over-ons pages have been successfully updated to ensure they only display content that is directly fetched from Strapi. The only exceptions are the navbar/header, footer, subfooter (which were already handled separately), page metadata, and minimal fallback texts for edge cases.

Both pages now follow a consistent pattern:
1. Attempt to fetch content from Strapi
2. Display dynamic content if available
3. Display a minimal error message if unavailable

This approach ensures that all main content is sourced from Strapi while maintaining a good user experience in case of API failures.

Additionally, we fixed an issue with the feature grid component not displaying properly by updating the populate parameters in the API request to correctly fetch nested relationships. This ensures that all components, including complex ones with nested data, are properly populated from Strapi.
