# Feature Grid Integration Fix

## Overview

This document details the efforts to fix the feature grid component display issues on the MaasISO website. The feature grid component was not displaying correctly on the diensten page, with features not being properly fetched from the Strapi CMS.

## Problem Description

The feature grid component on the diensten page was not displaying any features, despite the features being properly configured in the Strapi CMS. The issue was related to how the features were being fetched and processed from the Strapi API.

### Specific Issues

1. **API Response Structure**: The Strapi API was returning a 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to fetch the feature grid data with deep populate parameters.

2. **Feature Extraction Logic**: The code that extracts features from the Strapi response was not handling all possible data structures correctly.

3. **JSX Rendering Issues**: There were syntax errors in the JSX code that prevented the page from rendering correctly.

## Solution Attempts

### Attempt 1: Modify API Populate Parameters

We attempted to modify the populate parameters in the API request to ensure that the features were properly included in the response:

```typescript
// Enhanced populate parameters for Strapi v4
const enhancedPopulate = [
  // Base populate for top-level fields
  'populate[layout]=*',
  
  // Deep populate for feature grid components
  'populate[layout][populate][features]=*',
  'populate[layout][populate][features][populate][icon]=*',
  
  // Deep populate for hero components
  'populate[layout][populate][backgroundImage]=*',
  'populate[layout][populate][ctaButton]=*',
  
  // Deep populate for gallery components
  'populate[layout][populate][images]=*',
].join('&');
```

However, this resulted in a 500 Internal Server Error from the Strapi API.

### Attempt 2: Create a Custom API Endpoint

We created a custom API endpoint to fetch the feature grid data directly from Strapi:

```typescript
// app/api/feature-grid-data/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const searchParams = request.nextUrl.searchParams;
    const id = searchParams.get('id');

    if (!id) {
      return NextResponse.json({
        status: 'error',
        message: 'Missing feature grid ID parameter',
      }, { status: 400 });
    }

    const strapiUrl = process.env.STRAPI_URL || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL;
    const token = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_TOKEN;

    // Fetch the feature grid data from Strapi
    // Try multiple endpoints to see which one works
    const endpoints = [
      // Try to get the feature grid component directly
      `${strapiUrl}/api/components/page-blocks.feature-grid/${id}?populate=*`,
      // Try to get the feature grid from the feature-grids collection
      `${strapiUrl}/api/feature-grids/${id}?populate=*`,
      // Try to get the features directly
      `${strapiUrl}/api/features?filters[feature_grid][id][$eq]=${id}&populate=*`
    ];

    // Try each endpoint until one works
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
  }
}
```

### Attempt 3: Simplify the Page Component

We simplified the diensten page component to isolate the issue:

```typescript
export default function DienstenPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Diensten</h1>
      <p>Deze pagina wordt momenteel bijgewerkt.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This basic component rendered correctly, confirming that there was an issue with the JSX syntax in the more complex component.

## Current Status

The feature grid component is still not displaying correctly on the diensten page. We've identified several issues:

1. The Strapi API returns a 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to fetch the feature grid data with deep populate parameters.
2. There are syntax errors in the JSX code that prevent the page from rendering correctly.
3. The feature extraction logic needs to be improved to handle all possible data structures.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Strapi API Issues**:
   - Investigate the 500 Internal Server Error on the Strapi server
   - Check Strapi logs for specific error details
   - Ensure Strapi service is running with sufficient resources

2. **Improve Feature Extraction Logic**:
   - Simplify the feature extraction logic
   - Create a more standardized approach to handling the Strapi response format

3. **Fix JSX Rendering Issues**:
   - Identify and fix the syntax errors in the JSX code
   - Test with a simplified component first, then gradually add complexity

4. **Implement Better Error Handling**:
   - Add more detailed logging to capture the exact raw response structure from Strapi
   - Implement graceful fallbacks when API calls fail

## Conclusion

The feature grid component display issues are complex and involve multiple layers of the application. A systematic approach is needed to address each issue, starting with fixing the Strapi API issues, then improving the feature extraction logic, and finally fixing the JSX rendering issues.
