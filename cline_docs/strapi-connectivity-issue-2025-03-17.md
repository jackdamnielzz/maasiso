# Strapi Connectivity Issue Analysis
Date: March 17, 2025

## Issue Description
Pages that fetch content from Strapi (VPS1) are failing to load due to connection timeouts.

## Diagnostic Results

### 1. Server Status
- Server IP: 153.92.223.23
- DNS Resolution: Successful (resolves to srv692111.hstgr.cloud)
- Port 1337: Not responding
- TCP Connection: Failed
- Response Time: Timeout (>5 seconds)

### 2. Connection Tests
- Direct HTTP connection: Failed (timeout)
- API endpoint test: Failed (timeout)
- Network route: TCP test failed

### 3. Current Configuration
- Backend URL: http://153.92.223.23:1337
- Strapi Token: Present and valid
- CORS Configuration: Present but may need updating

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue appears to be that the Strapi server is not responding on port 1337. This could be due to:

1. Strapi process not running
2. Firewall blocking port 1337
3. Server resource exhaustion
4. Network connectivity issues at VPS1

## Recommended Actions

1. Immediate Steps:
   - SSH into VPS1 to check Strapi process status
   - Verify PM2 process is running
   - Check server resources (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Review Strapi logs for errors

2. Server Checks:
   ```bash
   # Check if Strapi is running
   pm2 status strapi

   # Check server resources
   top -b -n 1
   df -h

   # Check Strapi logs
   pm2 logs strapi --lines 100
   ```

3. Firewall Verification:
   ```bash
   # Check if port 1337 is open
   netstat -tulpn | grep :1337

   # Verify firewall rules
   iptables -L
   ```

4. Network Connectivity:
   - Verify network interface status
   - Check for any network restrictions
   - Verify DNS settings

## Next Steps

1. Execute server checks via SSH
2. Restart Strapi if necessary
3. Update CORS configuration to include development URLs
4. Monitor server resources
5. Consider implementing health checks

## Impact
- All pages requiring Strapi content are affected
- Content cannot be fetched from the CMS
- Dynamic pages show empty or error states

## Long-term Recommendations

1. Implement server monitoring
2. Set up automated health checks
3. Configure backup CMS instance
4. Implement proper error handling for CMS downtime
5. Document server recovery procedures
