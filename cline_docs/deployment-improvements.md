## Usage

```powershell
# Standard deployment
.\scripts\direct-deploy.ps1

# Skip build phase
.\scripts\direct-deploy.ps1 -SkipBuild

# More thorough health checks
.\scripts\direct-deploy.ps1 -HealthCheckRetries 10 -HealthCheckDelay 5
```

## Monitoring

1. View application logs:
```powershell
ssh -i "~/.ssh/maasiso_vps" root@147.93.62.188 'pm2 logs frontend'
```

2. Check process status:
```powershell
ssh -i "~/.ssh/maasiso_vps" root@147.93.62.188 'pm2 show frontend'
```

3. Monitor health:
```powershell
./scripts/monitor-health.ps1
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues Fixed

1. **Node.js Version Mismatch**
   - Automatic detection and upgrade
   - Compatibility mode for dependencies
   - Legacy peer dependency support

2. **Process Hangs**
   - Automatic detection
   - Process cleanup
   - Forced termination when needed

3. **File Permission Issues**
   - Proper file ownership
   - Correct permission settings
   - Temporary directory usage

4. **Deployment Failures**
   - Automatic rollback
   - Better error reporting
   - Health check verification

## Best Practices

1. **Before Deployment**
   - Check Node.js version
   - Verify disk space
   - Review changes
   - Check system resources

2. **During Deployment**
   - Monitor logs
   - Watch for errors
   - Check process status
   - Verify health endpoints

3. **After Deployment**
   - Verify functionality
   - Check logs
   - Monitor performance
   - Clean old backups

## Security Considerations

1. **Process Security**
   - Limited permissions
   - Proper file ownership
   - Secure environment variables

2. **File Security**
   - Proper file permissions
   - Secure temporary files
   - Clean file cleanup

3. **Deployment Security**
   - Secure backups
   - Protected rollbacks
   - Safe file transfers
