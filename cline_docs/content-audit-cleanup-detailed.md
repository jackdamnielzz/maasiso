# Detailed Content Audit and Cleanup Documentation

## Project: MaasISO Website
## Date: March 3, 2025
## Task: Systematic Content Audit and Cleanup for Diensten and Over-ons Pages

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the systematic audit and cleanup performed on the diensten and over-ons pages of the MaasISO website. The primary goal was to ensure that all content displayed on these pages is dynamically fetched from the Strapi CMS, with the exception of the navbar/header, footer, and subfooter components.

The audit revealed several issues:
1. Hardcoded content in both pages that should be coming from Strapi
2. A critical issue with the feature grid component not displaying properly due to incorrect populate parameters in the API requests
3. Inconsistent error handling for cases when Strapi data cannot be fetched

All issues have been successfully addressed, and both pages now display content that is dynamically fetched from Strapi, with proper error handling for cases when Strapi data cannot be fetched.

## 2. Initial Audit Findings

### 2.1 Diensten Page (app/diensten/page.tsx)

#### 2.1.1 Major Hardcoded Content Issues
- Large `fallbackFeatures` array (lines 17-143) containing hardcoded feature data
- Extensive fallback content with hardcoded hero section, feature grid, and CTA section
- Fallback content was used when Strapi API calls failed, instead of showing a simple error message

#### 2.1.2 Minor Hardcoded Content
- Page metadata (title, description, keywords) - This is acceptable as metadata is typically defined at the page level in Next.js
- Minimal fallback texts for component properties (e.g., feature titles, descriptions) - These are acceptable as they are only used when specific properties are missing from Strapi

### 2.2 Over-ons Page (app/over-ons/page.tsx)

#### 2.2.1 Major Hardcoded Content Issues
- Hardcoded content in the page-blocks.button component (title and description)
- Minimal fallback content for API failures (already implemented correctly)

#### 2.2.2 Minor Hardcoded Content
- Page metadata (title, description, keywords) - This is acceptable as metadata is typically defined at the page level in Next.js
- Minimal fallback texts for component properties - These are acceptable as they are only used when specific properties are missing from Strapi

### 2.3 API Data Fetching (src/lib/api.ts)

#### 2.3.1 Feature Grid Component Issue
- The feature grid component was not displaying properly because the features data was not being correctly fetched from Strapi
- The `getPage` function was using a simple populate parameter (`populate=*`) which doesn't deeply populate nested relationships like the features in a feature grid component
- The console logs showed that the feature grid component was being found in the Strapi response, but it didn't have any features data:

```
[Feature Extraction] Raw component structure: {
  id: 51,
  type: 'page-blocks.feature-grid',
  hasFeatures: false,
  featuresType: 'undefined',
  isArray: false,
  hasData: false
}
[Feature Extraction] No valid features structure found, returning empty array
```

## 3. Changes Made

### 3.1 Diensten Page (app/diensten/page.tsx)

#### 3.1.1 Removed Hardcoded Content
- Removed the entire `fallbackFeatures` array (lines 17-143)
- Replaced extensive fallback content with a simple error message
- Simplified the fallback rendering to match the approach used in over-ons page

#### 3.1.2 Retained Content
- Kept page metadata (standard practice in Next.js)
- Kept minimal fallback texts for component properties to handle edge cases

### 3.2 Over-ons Page (app/over-ons/page.tsx)

#### 3.2.1 Updated Content
- Modified the page-blocks.button component to use data from Strapi
- Added fallback values for title and description that only apply when Strapi data is missing
- Fixed syntax issues in the template literals

#### 3.2.2 Retained Content
- Kept page metadata
- Kept minimal fallback texts for component properties

### 3.3 API Data Fetching (src/lib/api.ts)

#### 3.3.1 Updated Content Fetching
- Modified the `getPage` function to use a more appropriate populate parameter (`populate[layout][populate]=*`) that correctly fetches nested relationships:

```typescript
// Before
const simplePopulate = 'populate=*';
const directUrl = `${strapiUrl}/api/pages?filters[slug][$eq]=${slug}&${simplePopulate}&${cacheBuster}`;

// After
const simplePopulate = 'populate[layout][populate]=*';
const directUrl = `${strapiUrl}/api/pages?filters[slug][$eq]=${slug}&${simplePopulate}&${cacheBuster}`;
```

- Updated the indexed populate parameters to include the features.link field:

```typescript
const indexedPopulate = [
  'populate[0]=layout',
  'populate[1]=layout.features',
  'populate[2]=layout.features.icon',
  'populate[5]=layout.features.link', // Added this line
  'populate[3]=layout.backgroundImage',
  'populate[4]=layout.ctaButton'
].join('&');
```

- Ensured that all components, including feature grids with nested features, are properly populated from Strapi

## 4. Testing and Verification

### 4.1 Test Script Creation
- Created a test script (`scripts/test-content-dynamic.js`) to verify that pages are correctly fetching and displaying content from Strapi
- The script tests both the diensten and over-ons pages to ensure they display dynamic content when Strapi data is available and fallback content when Strapi data is unavailable
- Added documentation on how to run the tests and verify the changes (`scripts/README-content-testing.md`)

### 4.2 Dynamic Content Rendering
- Verified that both pages now attempt to fetch content from Strapi
- Confirmed that both pages display dynamic content when Strapi data is available
- Checked that both pages display a minimal error message when Strapi data is unavailable

### 4.3 Error Handling
- Enhanced error logging for API failures
- Simplified fallback UI for error states
- Ensured consistent error handling across both pages

### 4.4 Content Source Verification
- Confirmed that all main content now comes directly from Strapi
- Verified that only minimal fallbacks remain for edge cases
- Ensured no extensive hardcoded content remains

### 4.5 Feature Grid Verification
- Verified that the feature grid component on the diensten page is correctly displaying data from Strapi
- Confirmed that all 6 features are being properly extracted and displayed
- Visually inspected the page to ensure the feature grid is rendering correctly
- Checked the console logs to confirm that features are being properly extracted:

```
[Feature Extraction] Raw component structure: {
  id: 53,
  type: 'page-blocks.feature-grid',
  hasFeatures: true,
  featuresType: 'object',
  isArray: true,
  hasData: false
}
[Feature Extraction] Found direct array with 6 items
[Feature Extraction] Extracted 6 features
[Feature Extraction] First feature: {
  id: '224',
  title: 'ISO 27001 Informatiebeveiliging',
  description: 'Bescherm uw kritieke gegevens en waarborg de continuïteit van uw bedrijf met onze expertise in risicobeoordeling, beleidsontwikkeling, implementatie van beveiligingscontroles en continuïteitsplanning.',
  icon: undefined,
  link: ''
}
```

## 6. Lessons Learned

### 6.1 Strapi API Integration
- When working with Strapi, it's important to use the correct populate parameters to fetch nested relationships
- The `populate=*` parameter doesn't deeply populate nested relationships, so more specific populate parameters are needed for complex data structures
- Testing endpoints can be a valuable resource for understanding how to correctly fetch data from Strapi

### 6.2 Content Management
- Hardcoded content should be avoided in favor of dynamic content fetched from a CMS
- Minimal fallbacks are acceptable for edge cases, but extensive fallback content should be avoided
- Consistent error handling is important for providing a good user experience when CMS data cannot be fetched

### 6.3 Testing and Verification
- Automated tests are valuable for verifying that pages are correctly fetching and displaying content from a CMS
- Visual inspection is still important for ensuring that components are rendering correctly
- Console logs can provide valuable insights into how data is being processed

## 7. Next Steps

### 7.1 Short-term
- Continue monitoring for any other components that may have issues with nested data structures
- Test all pages to verify they display the most up-to-date content from Strapi
- Make changes in Strapi and verify they are immediately reflected on the website

### 7.2 Medium-term
- Monitor page load times to ensure they remain acceptable without caching
- Monitor server load to ensure it can handle the increased number of API calls
- Develop schema adapter to normalize Strapi responses
- Consider implementing server-side caching at the Strapi level if performance becomes an issue

### 7.3 Long-term
- Create a more robust CMS integration layer
- Implement comprehensive end-to-end testing
- Develop a monitoring solution for component rendering issues
- Consider implementing server-side rendering optimizations if performance becomes an issue

## 8. Conclusion

The diensten and over-ons pages have been successfully updated to ensure they only display content that is directly fetched from Strapi. The only exceptions are the navbar/header, footer, subfooter (which were already handled separately), page metadata, and minimal fallback texts for edge cases.

Both pages now follow a consistent pattern:
1. Attempt to fetch content from Strapi
2. Display dynamic content if available
3. Display a minimal error message if unavailable

This approach ensures that all main content is sourced from Strapi while maintaining a good user experience in case of API failures.

Additionally, we fixed an issue with the feature grid component not displaying properly by updating the populate parameters in the API request to correctly fetch nested relationships. This ensures that all components, including complex ones with nested data, are properly populated from Strapi.

The changes made in this task have significantly improved the maintainability and reliability of the MaasISO website by ensuring that all content is managed through the Strapi CMS, rather than being hardcoded in the frontend.
