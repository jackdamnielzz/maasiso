# Maasiso Website Project Handover Documentation

## Executive Summary
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Maasiso website project, detailing the current state, challenges faced, and proposed solutions. The project consists of a Next.js frontend and Strapi CMS backend, distributed across two VPS instances.

## Project Context

### Infrastructure Overview
- VPS1 (153.92.223.23): Hosts Strapi CMS
- VPS2 (147.93.62.188): Hosts Next.js frontend
- Local Development Environment: Next.js with automated sync capabilities

### Technical Stack
1. Frontend
   - Next.js 15.1.6
   - TypeScript
   - Tailwind CSS
   - Custom API integration layer

2. Backend
   - Strapi CMS
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Custom API endpoints

3. Development Tools
   - PowerShell automation scripts
   - SSH/SCP for file transfer
   - Environment variable management
   - Build process automation

## Current Status

### Working Features
1. Infrastructure
   - Two-VPS architecture
   - Basic networking setup
   - Environment configuration

2. Development Tools
   - File synchronization scripts
   - Deployment automation
   - Progress indicators
   - Error logging

3. Frontend Application
   - Next.js app router implementation
   - Server and client components
   - API proxy layer
   - Static page generation

### Known Issues

1. Authentication (Critical)
   - 401 Unauthorized errors during build process
   - Token validation failures
   - Environment variable synchronization issues
   - Impact: Prevents successful production builds

2. Build Process (High Priority)
   - Static generation failures for news pages
   - API timeout issues
   - File permission problems
   - Impact: Blocks deployment workflow

3. Development Workflow (Medium Priority)
   - Manual intervention requirements
   - Incomplete error reporting
   - File locking issues
   - Impact: Reduces development efficiency

## Attempted Solutions

### Authentication Issues
1. SSH Key Authentication
   ```powershell
   # Generated SSH key pair
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\maasiso_rsa"
   
   # Attempted key deployment
   ssh-copy-id root@147.93.62.188
   ```
   Result: Permission issues persisted

2. Environment Variable Management
   ```bash
   # Synchronized .env file
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api/proxy
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_TOKEN=[token]
   STRAPI_URL=http://153.92.223.23:1337
   ```
   Result: Token validation still fails

3. Automated Password Handling
   ```powershell
   # PowerShell process handling
   $pinfo = New-Object System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo
   $pinfo.RedirectStandardInput = $true
   ```
   Result: Inconsistent behavior

### Build Process Improvements
1. Production Configuration
   ```javascript
   // next.config.js optimizations
   module.exports = {
     output: 'standalone',
     typescript: {
       tsconfigPath: './tsconfig.prod.json'
     }
   }
   ```

2. File System Handling
   ```powershell
   # Improved file operations
   Set-Location $LOCAL_PATH
   Remove-Item -Path $TEMP_DIR -Recurse -Force
   ```

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Authentication
   - Implement token refresh mechanism
   - Add request retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Enhance error handling and reporting

2. Build Process
   - Add pre-build validation steps
   - Implement progressive deployment
   - Add rollback capabilities

3. Development Workflow
   - Automate environment setup
   - Improve error reporting
   - Add health checks

### Long-term Improvements
1. Infrastructure
   - Implement load balancing
   - Add CDN integration
   - Set up monitoring system

2. Development
   - Create automated testing suite
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline
   - Automate documentation updates

## Technical Debt

### High Priority
1. Authentication System
   - Token management needs redesign
   - Error recovery system missing
   - Logging inadequate

2. Build Process
   - No atomic deployments
   - Missing rollback mechanism
   - Incomplete error handling

### Medium Priority
1. Development Workflow
   - Manual steps in deployment
   - Incomplete documentation
   - Limited monitoring
