# Current Task: Frontend Deployment Setup

## Progress Summary (2024-02-14)

### Completed Steps:

1. SSH Key Configuration ✅
- Generated ED25519 key pair using setup-ssh.ps1
- Created known_hosts entry for VPS2
- Added both secrets to GitHub repository:
  * VPS2_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
  * VPS2_KNOWN_HOSTS

2. Server Preparation ✅
- Installed PM2 globally on VPS2
- Created deployment directory: /var/www/jouw-frontend-website
- Set directory permissions to 755
- Created backup directory: /var/www/backups

3. Deployment Infrastructure ✅
- Created GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
- Implemented automatic rollback on failure
- Added health check endpoint (app/api/health/route.ts)
- Created monitoring script (scripts/monitor-health.ps1)
- Created backup script (scripts/backup-site.ps1)

4. Documentation ✅
- Created comprehensive deployment documentation (cline_docs/manuals/deployment_system.md)
- Documented all procedures and troubleshooting steps
- Added maintenance guidelines

### Current Status:
- All deployment files are created and pushed to GitHub
- GitHub repository secrets are configured
- Server is prepared with PM2 and required directories
- Ready to start monitoring and test deployment

### Next Steps:

1. Start Monitoring System
- Run monitoring script to track server health
- Configure alert thresholds
- Verify metrics collection

2. Test Deployment
- Trigger manual deployment through GitHub Actions
- Verify all deployment steps:
  * Build process
  * File transfer
  * Service restart
- Monitor deployment success
- Test rollback procedure if needed

3. Performance Verification
- Monitor application performance post-deployment
- Check memory and CPU usage
- Verify response times
- Test under load

4. Final Documentation Updates
- Add deployment test results
- Document any issues encountered
- Update troubleshooting guide if needed
- Add monitoring dashboard access info

## Current Position
We are at the point where all infrastructure is set up and ready to begin the testing phase. The next immediate step is to start the monitoring system and trigger a test deployment.
