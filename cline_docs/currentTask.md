## Task: Deploy Next.js Application to Production

### Current Step
Configuring DNS records in Hostinger for maasiso.nl

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Log in to Hostinger account
2. Navigate to DNS management for maasiso.nl
3. Add two A records:
   ```
   Type: A
   Host: @ (or leave blank)
   Points to: 147.93.62.188
   TTL: 14400
   ```
   ```
   Type: A
   Host: www
   Points to: 147.93.62.188
   TTL: 14400
   ```

### Server Status
- VPS IP: 147.93.62.188
- Next.js running on port 3000 via PM2
- Nginx configured and running
- All services operational

### Blocking Issues
- DNS configuration pending
- Cannot proceed with SSL setup until DNS is configured

### Next Steps (After DNS Configuration)
1. Wait for DNS propagation
2. Install Certbot
3. Configure SSL certificates
4. Enable HTTPS

### Reference Files
- Full deployment status: cline_docs/deployment_status.md
- Memory bank: cline_docs/memory_bank.md
- Nginx config: /etc/nginx/sites-available/maasiso
- PM2 config: /var/www/maasiso/frontend/ecosystem.config.js

### Notes
- DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate
- Keep monitoring server status during propagation
- Document any issues or changes in deployment_status.md
