# Current Task: Website Synchronization and Deployment Workflow Optimization

## Task Overview
Implementing a robust synchronization system between local development environment and VPS2 production server, with focus on streamlining the deployment process and maintaining environment parity.

## Current Status
- Created automated sync and deployment scripts
- Implemented environment variable handling
- Experiencing authentication issues with Strapi CMS

## Technical Details

### Infrastructure
- VPS1 (153.92.223.23): Strapi CMS
- VPS2 (147.93.62.188): Next.js Frontend
- Local Development Environment: Next.js with automated sync capabilities

### Implementation Progress

#### Completed
1. Created PowerShell scripts for synchronization:
   - sync.ps1: Downloads production files
   - deploy.ps1: Deploys local changes to production

2. Environment Configuration:
   - Implemented .env file synchronization
   - Set up proper environment variables for Strapi connection

3. Deployment Automation:
   - Automated file transfer using SCP
   - Implemented build process automation
   - Added progress indicators for better visibility

#### Current Issues
1. Authentication:
   - Strapi CMS returning 401 Unauthorized errors
   - Token validation issues during build process

2. File System:
   - Handling file locks during sync operations
   - Managing node_modules and .next directories

#### Attempted Solutions
1. SSH Authentication:
   - Tried SSH key-based authentication
   - Attempted automated password handling
   - Experimented with environment variables for credentials

2. Build Process:
   - Modified Next.js configuration for production builds
   - Adjusted TypeScript settings via tsconfig.prod.json
   - Implemented error handling in build scripts

### Next Steps
1. Resolve Strapi authentication issues:
   - Verify token validity
   - Implement proper token refresh mechanism
   - Add error recovery for authentication failures

2. Enhance sync process:
   - Implement atomic file operations
   - Add rollback capabilities
   - Improve error handling and reporting

3. Documentation:
   - Update deployment workflows
   - Create troubleshooting guides
   - Document common issues and solutions
