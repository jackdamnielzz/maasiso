# Current Task: Development Server Performance Optimization

## Task Status: IN PROGRESS

### Objective
Optimize development server performance and prepare the application for production deployment.

### Current Progress

1. Monitoring Service Optimization ✓
   - Disabled monitoring in development environment
   - Reduced buffer size to 500 events
   - Implemented batch processing (100 events per batch)
   - Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Improved cleanup handling
   - Added resource timing cleanup

2. Development Server Improvements ✓
   - Blocked metrics API endpoint in development
   - Added comprehensive error handling
   - Implemented graceful shutdown
   - Added specific error messages

### Current Challenges

1. Build Process Issues
   - Permission error with .next/trace directory
   - Need to resolve build process permissions
   - Investigating proper cleanup procedures

2. Production Readiness
   - Testing production build configuration
   - Verifying monitoring in production environment
   - Ensuring proper error handling
   - Checking security headers

### Technical Details
- Next.js version: 15.1.6
- Node environment: Development/Production modes
- Custom server implementation
- TypeScript configuration: Using tsconfig.prod.json for production

### Implementation Details

1. Monitoring Service Changes
```typescript
class PerformanceMonitor {
  private readonly BUFFER_SIZE = 500;
  private readonly BATCH_SIZE = 100;
  private readonly RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3;
  private readonly RETRY_DELAY = 1000;
  private readonly METRICS_ENABLED = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
}
```

2. Server Improvements
```typescript
// Enhanced error handling
server.on('error', (err) => {
  if (err.code === 'EADDRINUSE') {
    console.error(`Port ${port} is already in use`);
  }
  process.exit(1);
});

// Graceful shutdown
process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  console.log('SIGTERM received, shutting down...');
  server.close(() => {
    console.log('Server closed');
    process.exit(0);
  });
});
```

### Next Steps
1. Resolve Build Issues
   - Fix permission errors
   - Implement proper cleanup
   - Verify build output

2. Production Testing
   - Test monitoring in production environment
   - Verify security headers
   - Check error handling
   - Monitor performance metrics

3. Documentation Updates
   - Update deployment guide
   - Document monitoring configuration
   - Add production checklist

### Notes
- Build process needs elevated permissions or alternative approach
- Consider implementing automated cleanup procedures
- Monitor memory usage in development environment
- Test production build on staging environment first
