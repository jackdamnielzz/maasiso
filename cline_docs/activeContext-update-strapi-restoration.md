# Active Context Update: Strapi Restoration Task
Date: March 17, 2025

## Current Task: Strapi CMS Restoration

We are undertaking a critical task to restore full functionality to the Strapi CMS running at http://153.92.223.23:1337. This task is essential as the frontend relies on direct API calls to Strapi for content, and the current issues are preventing proper content display.

### Integration with Previous Work

This task directly relates to our previous work on removing the caching system:

1. **Cache Removal Impact**: With the cache removal completed, the website now relies exclusively on direct Strapi API calls
2. **Current Impact**: The Strapi issues are causing content pages to fail or display error states
3. **Critical Priority**: This restoration is now the highest priority as it directly affects all content pages

### Task Components

We have created a comprehensive set of documentation to guide the Strapi restoration:

1. **Master Plan**: `strapi-restoration-master-plan.md` - The comprehensive restoration strategy
2. **Database Restoration**: `strapi-database-restoration-plan.md` - Steps to restore the database from backup
3. **Plugin Repair**: `strapi-plugin-repair-strategy.md` - Solution for plugin-related issues
4. **Authentication Strategy**: `strapi-authentication-strategy.md` - Addressing API token and authentication issues
5. **Task Summary**: `strapi-restoration-task-2025-03-17.md` - Task-oriented summary of the restoration process

### Current Status

The Strapi instance has multiple critical issues:

1. **Admin Interface**: Accessible but shows no content
2. **Database**: Connected but appears empty (backup available at `/root/strapi_backup.sql`)
3. **Users & Permissions Plugin**: Showing 404 errors
4. **Runtime Errors**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pluginOptions')"
5. **API Authentication**: Frontend making requests but receiving 401 errors

### Implementation Plan

The restoration will be executed in four sequential phases:

#### Phase 1: Database Restoration
- Back up the current empty database
- Restore from `/root/strapi_backup.sql`
- Verify data integrity

#### Phase 2: Plugin Repair
- Fix the Users & Permissions plugin
- Address "pluginOptions" errors
- Reinstall plugins if necessary

#### Phase 3: Authentication Configuration
- Configure role permissions
- Set up API token properly
- Test API access

#### Phase 4: Content Verification
- Verify all content is accessible
- Test API endpoints
- Validate frontend integration

### Timeline and Resources

- **Timeline**: 1-2 days for complete restoration
- **Server Access**: SSH access to VPS1 (153.92.223.23)
- **Database Access**: PostgreSQL credentials for strapi_db
- **Key Personnel**: System administrator with root access

### Success Criteria

The task will be considered complete when:

1. ✅ Database is restored with all original content
2. ✅ Users & Permissions plugin functions correctly
3. ✅ API authentication works properly
4. ✅ Content is visible in the admin interface
5. ✅ Frontend can fetch and display content

### Next Steps After Completion

1. **Content Testing**: Thoroughly test all content pages
2. **Documentation Update**: Document the restoration process
3. **Monitoring Implementation**: Set up health checks for early detection of issues
4. **Regular Backups**: Implement automated database backups
5. **Return to Main Task**: Resume work on any remaining cache removal tasks

## Note for Memory Bank

This active context update should be appended to the existing activeContext.md file rather than replacing it, as it represents a new task interacting with the previously documented work on cache removal.
