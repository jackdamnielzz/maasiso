## Next Development Priorities

### Immediate Priorities (March 18, 2025)
1. Fix Next.js App Router TypeScript errors:
   - Resolve page props type mismatch in blog/[slug]/page.tsx
   - Fix metadata generation types
   - Update type definitions for dynamic routes
2. Complete VPS2 deployment:
   - Fix remaining TypeScript errors
   - Run successful build
   - Deploy and verify functionality
3. Update documentation:
   - Document TypeScript fixes
   - Update deployment guides
   - Create type system documentation

### Short-term
1. ✅ Test all pages to verify they display the most up-to-date content from Strapi
2. ✅ Make changes in Strapi and verify they are immediately reflected on the website
3. ✅ Test error handling to ensure pages handle Strapi API failures gracefully
4. ✅ Verify the feature grid component on the diensten page displays correctly with the new approach
5. ✅ Create dedicated page component for onze-voordelen with consistent styling
6. ✅ Add appropriate icons to feature grid tiles on all pages (onze-voordelen, diensten, etc.)
7. Deploy the Strapi token fix to production using the direct-deploy.ps1 script
8. Continue monitoring for any other components that may have issues with nested data structures
9. Execute VPS1 server cleanup plan after verifying current disk usage

### Medium-term
1. Implement stricter TypeScript configurations:
   - Enable strict mode across all components
   - Add comprehensive type checking
   - Create type validation tests
2. Monitor page load times to ensure they remain acceptable without caching
2. Monitor server load to ensure it can handle the increased number of API calls
3. Develop schema adapter to normalize Strapi responses
4. Consider implementing server-side caching at the Strapi level if performance becomes an issue
5. Implement a more robust approach for handling deeply nested relationships in Strapi responses
6. Implement regular server maintenance schedule for VPS1 and VPS2
7. Set up disk space monitoring and alerts for both servers

### Long-term
1. Create a more robust CMS integration layer
2. Implement comprehensive end-to-end testing
3. Develop a monitoring solution for component rendering issues
4. Consider implementing server-side rendering optimizations if performance becomes an issue
5. Implement a more efficient approach for handling complex data structures in Strapi
6. Develop automated server maintenance scripts for routine cleanup tasks
