# Project Progress Report

## Current Status: Active Development
Last Updated: 2/4/2025, 11:02 PM (Europe/Amsterdam)

## Recent Achievements

### 1. Performance Optimization
- Implemented monitoring service improvements
  * Disabled in development environment
  * Reduced memory usage with smaller buffer
  * Added batch processing
  * Improved error handling
- Enhanced development server
  * Added proper error handling
  * Implemented graceful shutdown
  * Blocked unnecessary endpoints in development

### 2. Build System
- Identified and documented build process issues
  * Permission errors with .next/trace directory
  * Need for elevated permissions or alternative approach
- Production configuration improvements
  * Using production-specific TypeScript config
  * Enhanced security headers
  * Optimized bundle size

## Current Challenges

### 1. Build Process
- Permission issues during build
- Need for proper cleanup procedures
- Build optimization requirements

### 2. Production Readiness
- Testing production configuration
- Verifying monitoring in production
- Security considerations
- Performance validation

## Ongoing Tasks

### 1. Build System Resolution
- [ ] Fix permission errors
- [ ] Implement cleanup procedures
- [ ] Verify build output
- [ ] Test on staging environment

### 2. Production Preparation
- [ ] Complete production build testing
- [ ] Verify monitoring configuration
- [ ] Test security measures
- [ ] Document deployment process

### 3. Documentation

- [x] Created new current task documentation
- [ ] Update deployment guide
- [ ] Create production checklist

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Monitoring Service
```typescript
// Key improvements
- BUFFER_SIZE reduced to 500

- Added retry mechanism
- Improved cleanup handling
```

### 2. Server Configuration
```typescript
// Enhanced error handling
- Specific error messages
- Graceful shutdown
- Development mode optimizations
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
