# Feature Grid Integration Fix

## Problem Summary
The feature grid component was not displaying on the /diensten page despite being properly configured in Strapi CMS. Diagnostic analysis revealed a data structure mismatch between what the API returned and what our frontend expected.

## Root Causes
1. **Data Structure Variations**: The Strapi API returned features in different possible structures:
   - Direct array: `component.features` as an array
   - Nested data property: `component.features.data` as an array of items with attributes
   - Alternative structure: `component.data.features` as an array

2. **Validation Limitations**: The validation system was only checking for one structure format, causing false negatives.

3. **Parsing Logic**: The `mapPage` function in `src/lib/api.ts` was only handling the direct array format, failing to extract features from alternative structures.

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Type Definitions
Updated `RawFeatureGridComponent` in `src/lib/types.ts` to support multiple data structures:
```typescript
export interface RawFeatureGridComponent extends RawStrapiComponent {
  // Support for different data structures that might come from Strapi
  features?: RawFeature[] | { 
    data?: Array<{id: number|string, attributes?: any}> 
  };
  data?: {
    features?: RawFeature[];
  };
}
```

### 2. Improved Feature Extraction Logic
Enhanced the `mapPage` function in `src/lib/api.ts` to handle multiple data structure formats:
```typescript
// Enhanced feature handling to support multiple potential data structures
let extractedFeatures: any[] = [];

if (Array.isArray(component.features)) {
  // Direct array structure
  extractedFeatures = component.features;
  console.log(`[mapPage] Found direct features array with ${extractedFeatures.length} items`);
} else if (component.features?.data && Array.isArray(component.features.data)) {
  // Nested data property structure (common in Strapi responses)
  extractedFeatures = component.features.data.map((item: any) => {
    // Check if the item has attributes that need extraction
    if (item.attributes) {
      return { id: item.id, ...item.attributes };
    }
    return item;
  });
  console.log(`[mapPage] Found nested data features with ${extractedFeatures.length} items`);
} else if (component.data?.features && Array.isArray(component.data.features)) {
  // Alternative nested structure
  extractedFeatures = component.data.features;
  console.log(`[mapPage] Found alternative nested features with ${extractedFeatures.length} items`);
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Validation
Updated the component validation function to check for all possible data structures:
```typescript
// Enhanced validation that checks multiple possible structures
// for features data in Strapi responses
const hasDirectFeatures = Array.isArray(featureGridComponent.features);
const hasNestedFeatures = !!featureGridComponent.features?.data && 
                        Array.isArray((featureGridComponent.features as any).data);
const hasAlternativeFeatures = !!featureGridComponent.data?.features && 
                           Array.isArray(featureGridComponent.data.features);

if (!hasDirectFeatures && !hasNestedFeatures && !hasAlternativeFeatures) {
  console.warn(`[API Validation] Feature grid missing features at index ${index} - checked direct array, data.features, and nested structures`);
  isValid = false;
  return isValid;
}
```

### 4. Debugging and Testing Endpoints
Created several diagnostic endpoints to verify the fix:
- `app/api/debug-feature-extraction/route.ts`: Comprehensive feature extraction test
- `app/api/test-feature-grid/route.ts`: Specialized feature grid structure analysis
- `app/api/refresh-diensten/route.ts`: Endpoint to refresh diensten page data and validate fixes

## Verification
The fix successfully handles all variations of data structure that might come from Strapi. The feature grid now properly appears on the /diensten page regardless of which structure the API returns.

## Lessons Learned
1. API responses from headless CMS systems like Strapi can vary in structure based on different query parameters and contexts
2. Type definitions should be flexible enough to handle these variations
3. Validation should check for multiple valid representations of data
4. Extraction logic should be resilient and adaptable to different response formats

## Future Improvements
1. Consider implementing a more generic schema adapter that can normalize different Strapi response formats
2. Add more detailed logging and monitoring specifically for component data structure variations
3. Enhance typings to more precisely describe the potential variations of Strapi data structures
4. Implement automatic structure detection during the initial API call to reduce processing overhead
