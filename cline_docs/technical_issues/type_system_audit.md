# Type System Audit Results

## Content Types and Field Inconsistencies

### BlogPost
- Base type uses `publicationDate`
- Search type uses `publishedAt`
- Nested structures for categories and tags
- Inconsistent handling of optional fields

### NewsArticle
- Similar issues to BlogPost
- Uses `publicationDate` in base type
- Uses `publishedAt` in search results

### Event
- Uses both `eventDate` and `publishedAt`
- More consistent structure compared to other types
- Has specialized fields like `earlyBirdDiscount`

### Category
- Standalone type is flat:
  ```typescript
  {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    description?: string;
    slug: string;
    createdAt: string;
    updatedAt: string;
  }
  ```
- When nested in other types, uses Strapi's data/attributes structure:
  ```typescript
  {
    data: Array<{
      id: string;
      attributes: Category;
    }>;
  }
  ```

## Search Implementation Issues

### Type Mismatches
1. Date field inconsistencies:
   - Base types use `publicationDate`
   - Search results use `publishedAt`
   - Events use multiple date fields

2. Category structure inconsistencies:
   - Search results return simplified category structure
   - Base queries return full category data with nested attributes

3. Search result normalization:
   - Current SearchResult interface doesn't match actual API response
   - Separate interfaces for search vs. direct fetches

## API Implementation Analysis

### Current Pattern
- Direct fetches use full Strapi response structure
- Search queries use modified structure
- Inconsistent handling of optional fields
- No centralized normalization logic

### GraphQL Queries
- Search queries use different field names than direct fetches
- Pagination handling differs between content types
- Sort fields vary between types (`publicationDate` vs `eventDate`)

## Recommended Solutions

1. Implement normalization layer in api.ts
2. Standardize date field naming
3. Create consistent category structure
4. Update TypeScript interfaces to reflect normalized structure
5. Add proper type guards and validation

## Next Steps

1. Create normalized base interfaces
2. Implement transformation functions
3. Update API layer to use normalized types
4. Modify React components to expect consistent structures
5. Add proper error handling for type mismatches

## Impact Assessment

### Areas Requiring Updates
- /frontend/src/lib/types.ts
- /frontend/src/lib/api.ts
- Search-related components
- Blog and News article components
- Event components

### Potential Risks
- Breaking changes in component props
- Search functionality disruption during migration
- Need for extensive testing of all content types

## Migration Strategy

1. ✅ Implement changes in phases
2. ✅ Start with type definitions
   - Created BaseContent interface for common fields
   - Created normalized interfaces (BlogPost, NewsArticle, Event)
   - Created raw Strapi response types (StrapiRawBlogPost, StrapiRawNewsArticle, StrapiRawEvent)

3. ✅ Add normalization layer
   - Created normalizers.ts with functions to convert raw data to normalized types
   - Added type guards for runtime type checking
   - Implemented normalization for all content types

4. ✅ Update components incrementally
   - Updated BlogCard to use normalized BlogPost type
   - Updated EventCard to use normalized Event type
   - Updated RelatedPosts to use normalized types

5. ✅ Maintain backward compatibility during transition
   - API layer returns raw Strapi data
   - Components handle normalization at render time
   - Search functionality uses raw types directly

## Completed Changes

1. Type System
   - Introduced BaseContent interface for shared fields
   - Created separate interfaces for raw and normalized data
   - Added proper type guards and validation

2. API Layer
   - Updated to handle both raw and normalized data
   - Added proper type annotations for GraphQL responses
   - Improved error handling with typed error responses

3. Components
   - BlogCard now uses normalized BlogPost type
   - EventCard uses normalized Event type
   - Search page uses explicit raw type annotations

4. Pages
   - Blog pages handle normalization of raw data
   - Event pages use raw data with type assertions
   - Search page uses raw data with proper type annotations

## Future Considerations

1. Performance
   - Consider caching normalized data
   - Evaluate impact of runtime normalization
   - Consider server-side normalization for large datasets

2. Maintenance
   - Keep type definitions in sync with Strapi schema
   - Document normalization patterns for new content types
   - Monitor for any type-related issues in production

3. Developer Experience
   - Consider generating types from GraphQL schema
   - Add more comprehensive type guards
   - Improve error messages for type mismatches
