# Cache Removal Documentation

## Overview

The caching system has been completely removed from the MaasISO website to ensure that all content on the website is always fetched directly from Strapi without any caching. This ensures that changes in the CMS are immediately reflected on the website.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Layer Modifications

- Modified `src/lib/api.ts` to remove all caching functionality:
  - Removed imports from cacheService
  - Removed all cache-related code in the `getPage` function
  - Ensured all API calls are made directly to Strapi

### 2. Page Component Updates

- Updated all page components to use direct Strapi API calls:
  - Modified `app/diensten/page.tsx`
  - Modified `app/over-ons/page.tsx`
  - Modified `app/[slug]/page.tsx`
  - Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` and `export const revalidate = 0` to ensure pages are always rendered dynamically
- Removed extensive hardcoded fallback content from `app/over-ons/page.tsx` and replaced it with a minimal error message, consistent with the approach in `app/diensten/page.tsx`
  - This ensures that all content truly comes from Strapi, with no alternative content sources

### 3. Removed Cache-Related Files

- Removed API endpoints:
  - `app/api/refresh-cache/route.ts`
  - `app/api/test-cache/route.ts`
  - `app/api/refresh-page/route.ts`
- Removed cache service:
  - `src/lib/cacheService.ts`
- Removed cache population script:
  - `scripts/populate-cache.js`

### 4. Configuration Updates

- Updated `.gitignore` to remove cache-related entries

### 5. Testing Updates

- Updated `scripts/test-content-fetching.js` to test direct API calls instead of caching
- Created documentation in `cline_docs/direct-api-testing.md` for the new testing approach

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Content Updates**: All content changes in Strapi are immediately reflected on the website without any delay.
2. **Simplified Architecture**: Removed the complexity of managing a caching layer.
3. **Reduced Maintenance**: No need to maintain cache invalidation logic or handle cache-related issues.
4. **Consistent User Experience**: Users always see the most up-to-date content.
5. **Single Source of Truth**: By removing hardcoded fallback content, we ensure that Strapi is the only source of content for the website.

## Potential Considerations

1. **Performance**: Direct API calls may increase load times slightly compared to cached responses. However, this trade-off is acceptable given the requirement for real-time content updates.
2. **Server Load**: Increased number of API calls to Strapi may increase server load. Monitor server performance if needed.
3. **Error Handling**: With no extensive fallback content, proper error handling becomes more important to ensure users see appropriate messages when API calls fail.

## Testing

To verify the changes:
1. Make changes to content in Strapi CMS
2. Immediately check the website to confirm changes are reflected without delay
3. No cache refresh or manual intervention should be required
4. Test error scenarios by temporarily disabling Strapi access to ensure error messages display correctly
