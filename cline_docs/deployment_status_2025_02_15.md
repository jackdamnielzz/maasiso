   - Location: Germany
   - Specifications:
     * CPU: 2 cores
     * Memory: 8 GB
     * Storage: 100 GB
     * OS: Ubuntu 22.04

## Current Status

### What's Working
1. Frontend (VPS2):
   - Next.js application running successfully
   - PM2 process management operational
   - Nginx reverse proxy configured and running
   - Health monitoring endpoints active
   - Static file serving functional
   - API proxy to backend configured

2. Backend (VPS1):
   - Strapi CMS running and stable
   - PM2 process management operational
   - Database connections stable
   - API endpoints accessible
   - Admin panel functional

### Current Issues
1. Backend Access:
   - SSH key authentication not properly configured for VPS1
   - Currently relying on password authentication
   - Need to implement proper SSH key setup

2. Frontend Deployment:
   - Duplicate frontend installation attempt on VPS1 causing errors
   - Failed Next.js process needs cleanup
   - Build process not properly executed on VPS1

3. CORS Configuration:
   - Cross-origin resource sharing needs review
   - Frontend to backend communication requires optimization
   - Security headers need standardization

## Required Actions

### Immediate Priorities
1. VPS1 (Backend) Tasks:
   - Remove failed frontend installation
   - Configure proper SSH key authentication
   - Update CORS settings for frontend communication
   - Implement proper backup procedures

2. VPS2 (Frontend) Tasks:
   - Update environment variables to reflect correct backend URL
   - Implement automated deployment verification
   - Set up proper logging rotation
   - Configure monitoring alerts

### Security Improvements
1. SSH Access:
   - Generate and implement ED25519 SSH keys
   - Disable password authentication
   - Configure proper key rotation schedule
   - Document emergency access procedures

2. Application Security:
   - Review and update CSP headers
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Configure proper SSL/TLS settings
   - Set up security monitoring

## Deployment Process

### Current Workflow
1. Code Changes:
   - Development in local environment
   - Testing with local Strapi instance
   - Version control through Git
   - Manual deployment to production

2. Deployment Steps:
   - Frontend deployment through SFTP
   - Backend updates through direct server access
   - Manual service restart required
   - No automated rollback procedure

### Recommended Improvements
1. Automation:
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline
   - Automate deployment verification
   - Set up automatic backups
   - Create automated rollback procedures

2. Monitoring:
   - Implement comprehensive logging
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Configure error tracking
   - Establish uptime monitoring

## Documentation Status
