# VPS1 Server Cleanup Results
Date: March 17, 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the results of the VPS1 server cleanup operations performed on March 17, 2025. The cleanup was based on the plan outlined in `vps1-cleanup-plan-2025-03-17.md`.

## Initial State

- Total disk size: 194GB
- Used space: 11GB (6%)
- Available space: 183GB (94%)

### Largest Space Consumers (Before Cleanup)

1. PM2 logs in `/root/.pm2/logs`: 2.5GB
   - maasiso-error.log: 2.0GB
   - maasiso-out.log: 559MB
   - Other log files: ~59MB

2. NPM cache in `/root/.npm`: 979MB

3. Strapi node_modules in `/var/www/strapi/node_modules`: 1.2GB

## Cleanup Actions Performed

1. **Backup Essential Components**
   - Created backup directory: `/backups/strapi-essential-20250317`
   - Backed up essential Strapi files:
     - /var/www/strapi/dist
     - /var/www/strapi/public
     - /var/www/strapi/src
     - /var/www/strapi/config
     - /var/www/strapi/database
     - /var/www/strapi/.strapi
     - /var/www/strapi/.env
     - /var/www/strapi/package.json
     - /var/www/strapi/package-lock.json
     - /var/www/strapi/tsconfig.json
   - Backed up PostgreSQL database to `/backups/strapi-essential-20250317/strapi_db_backup.sql`

2. **PM2 Logs Cleanup**
   - Stopped PM2 processes
   - Attempted to flush PM2 logs using `pm2 flush` command
   - Manually removed large log files:
     - /root/.pm2/logs/maasiso-error.log (2.0GB)
     - /root/.pm2/logs/maasiso-out.log (559MB)
   - Restarted PM2 processes

3. **NPM Cache Cleanup**
   - Cleaned NPM cache using `npm cache clean --force`
   - Removed NPM _npx directory

4. **Strapi Node Modules Cleanup**
   - Stopped Strapi service
   - Removed node_modules directory
   - Reinstalled production dependencies using `npm install --production`
   - Restarted Strapi service

5. **APT Cache Cleanup**
   - Cleaned APT cache using `apt clean`
   - Removed unnecessary packages using `apt autoremove -y`

6. **PM2 Log Rotation Setup**
   - Installed pm2-logrotate module
   - Configured log rotation settings:
     - Maximum log size: 10MB
     - Number of logs to retain: 5
     - Compression enabled

## Final State

- Total disk size: 194GB
- Used space: 6.7GB (4%)
- Available space: 188GB (96%)

### Space Savings

- Total space saved: 4.3GB
- Percentage reduction: ~39%

### Current Space Usage

1. PM2 logs in `/root/.pm2/logs`: 76KB (reduced from 2.5GB)
2. NPM cache: Significantly reduced
3. Strapi node_modules: 976MB (reduced from 1.2GB)

## Verification

1. **Strapi Service Status**
   - Strapi is running correctly
   - Accessible at http://localhost:1337
   - Redirects to admin panel as expected

2. **Database Connection**
   - Database connection test script had issues
   - However, Strapi is running correctly, indicating the database connection is working

## Future Maintenance Recommendations

1. **Regular Log Monitoring**
   - Monitor PM2 logs to ensure log rotation is working properly
   - Check log sizes periodically

2. **Periodic Cleanup**
   - Schedule monthly cleanup of temporary files and caches
   - Consider implementing a cron job for automated cleanup

3. **Disk Space Monitoring**
   - Set up monitoring for disk space usage
   - Create alerts when disk space exceeds 80% usage

4. **Database Maintenance**
   - Regularly backup the PostgreSQL database
   - Consider implementing database optimization tasks

## Conclusion

The cleanup operations were successful, reducing the disk usage from 11GB to 6.7GB, a savings of 4.3GB or 39%. The server now has 188GB of free space (96% of total capacity). The Strapi service is running correctly after the cleanup, indicating that the essential components were preserved as intended.
